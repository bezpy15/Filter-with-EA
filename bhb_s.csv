25084,[Radiation response of mitochondria in dependence on their metabolic status (author's transl)].,"The influence of the metabolic status of mitochondria upon their radiation response was studied. It turned out that the reduction of pyridine nucleotides by addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOH) and the decrease through respiration were distinctly impaired in mitochondria with a substrate deficit by an irradiation with 2.7 krd already. The evolution of the lesion depends on the incubation conditions following irradiation, a presence of BOH having protective effects. The general redox level seems to be essential for radiation response of mitochondria. An exit of NAD from mitochondria has proved to be the main cause for inhibition of the respiratory BOH-consumption.",0,erythrocytes; thymocytes,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"influx, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,NS,NS,erythrocytes,Blood (non-nucleated),Erythrocytes / Reticulocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
126871,Effects of pH on beta-hydroxybutyrate transport in rat erythrocytes and thymocytes.,"Entry of beta-hydroxybutyrate into erythrocytes and thymocytes is facilitated by a carrier (C), as judged from temperature dependence, saturation kinetics, stereospecificity, competition with lactate and pyruvate, and inhibition by moderate concentrations of methylisobutylxanthine, phloretin, or alpha-cyanocinnamate. We studied the dependence of influx and efflux on internal and external pH and [beta-hydroxybutyrate]. Lowering external pH from 8.0 to 7.3 to 6.6 enhanced influx into erythrocytes by lowering entry Km from 29 to 16 to 10 mM, entry V being independent of external pH. Lowering external pH inhibited efflux. At low external pH, external beta-hydroxybutyrate enhanced efflux slightly. At high external pH, external beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibited efflux. Internal acidification inhibited influx and internal alkalization enhanced influx. Internal beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) enhanced influx more in acidified than alkalized cells. These data are compatible with coupled betaHB-/OH- exchange, betaHB- and OH- competing for influx, C:OH- moving faster than C: betaHB-, empty C being immobile. They are also compatible with coupled betaHB-/H+ copermeation, empty C moving inward faster than H+:C:betaHB-, H+:C being immobile, and C:betaHB- (without H+) being so unstable as not to be formed in significant amounts (relative to C, H+:C, and H+:C:betaHB-).",0,male rats (streptozotocin-induced diabetes),animal,Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan","1,3-butanediol (BD)","1,3-Butanediol (BD)",NS

Food consumption and rat weight were recorded daily. Whole blood glucose concentrations were determined weekly. At sacrifice, liver, pancreas and epididymal fat pads were excised and blood samples were collected. Liver was analyzed for protein and lipid; pancreas was weighed and analyzed for insulin; fat pads were weighed and discarded; and blood was analyzed for glucose and lipid. The 13.5% BD diet increased the beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and cholesterol concentrations, decreased the glucose concentration in blood, and increased the insulin content of the pancreas. The BD diets did not affect the concentrations of phospholipid, triglyceride, cholesterol and fatty acid in the liver; fatty acid concentrations in the blood; or the epididymal fat pad weight. The results suggest that BD produced a slight amelioration of the diabetic condition, which may have resulted from an increased capacity of the pancreas to synthesize insulin. In addition, the data provide further evidence suggesting that in the rat BD is oxidized to the ketone bodies, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate.",0,Azotobacter vinelandii (ATCC 12837); wild-type; nif- strains,in vitro,Animal – Invertebrate; NS,"encystment, up","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",NS,NS,wild-type cells,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",0.2% beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Competence in wild-type and nitrogenase auxotrophic (nif-) strains was repressed by the addition of ammonium salts or urea to the transformation medium. Transformation of wild-type cells and nif- strains was optimal on nitrogen-free or nitrogen-limiting medium, respectively. Transformation of wild-type cells also was enhanced when the transformation medium had low molydbate content. During the development of competence, nitrogen was growth limiting, whereas carbon (glucose) was in excess. Carbon source shift-down was not effective in inducing competence. Shifting glucose-grown wild-type cells to medium containing 0.2% beta-hydroxybutyrate initiated encystment and also induced competence. The addition of glucose to this medium blocked encystment and early competence induction and reduced the transformation frequency to the basal level. Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate induced competence in wild-type nitrogen-fixing cells and increased the transformation frequency 1,000-fold over the basal level. Exogenous cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate however, did not reverse nitrogen repression of competence in ammonia-grown wild-type or nif- strains.",0; PNPLA2; PDE3B,rat white fat cells; rat fat cells; rat adipose tissue; rat fat cell ghosts,animal,Animal – Rat,"inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation, down",Metabolic Regulation,white fat,Adipose tissue,fat cells,Adipose,White adipocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

However, lipolysis was unaffected by lactate. Octanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibited both cyclic AMP accumulation and lipolysis by rat fat cells. The mechanism by which these acids inhibit lipolysis differs from that for long chain fatty acids such as oleate. Oleate directly inhibited triglyceride lipase activity of homogenized rat adipose tissue. In contrast, octanoate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and lacatate had no effect on triglyceride lipase activity. Hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity of rat fat cell ghosts was inhibited by oleate and 4mM octanoate but not by 1.6 mM octanoate, heptanoate, hexanoate, beta-hydroxybutyrate or lactate. None of the acids affected the soluble protein kinase activity of rat adipose tissue. There was no stimulation by lactate, butyrate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, or octanoate of the soluble or particulate cyclic AMP antilipolytic action of a short chain acid such as octanoate or hexanoate was not accompanied by any drop in total fat cell ATP.

305789,Exercise-induced increase in the capacity of rat skeletal muscle to oxidize ketones.,"During and after strenuous prolonged exercise, sedentary individuals develop high blood levels of acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate whereas exercise-trained animals and human subjects do not. We have investigated the possibility that exercise training can increase the capacity of skeletal muscle to oxidize ketones. In this study we measured rates of D-beta[3-14-C]-hydroxybutyrate and [3-14-C]acetoacetate oxidation, and the levels of activity of the enzymes involved in the oxidation of ketones in homogenates of gastrocnemius muscles of exercise-trained and of untrained male rats. The trained animals had markedly lower blood ketone levels immediately and 60 min after a 90 min long bout of exercise than did the sedentary animals. The rates of D-beta-[13-14C]hydroxybutryate and [3-14-C]acetoacetate oxidation were twice as high in homogenates of muscles from the trained as compared to the sedentary rats. The increases in levels of activity in gastrocnemius muscle in response to the exercise program were: beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase threefold; 3-ketoacid CoA-transferase twofold; and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase 55%. This exercise-induced increase in the capacity of skeletal muscle to oxidize ketones could play a role in preventing development of ketosis in the physically trained animal during and following prolonged strenuous exercise.",0,erythrocytes; thymocytes,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"carboxylate transport site-mediated entry, NS",Ion & Nutrient Transport,thymocytes,Thymus,erythrocytes,Blood (non-nucleated),Erythrocytes / Reticulocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,D-BHB
318406,Characterization of beta-hydroxybutyrate transport in rat erythrocytes and thymocytes.,"A method was developed for study of beta-hydroxybutyrate transport in erythrocytes and thymocytes. Critical to the method was a centrifugal separation of cells from medium which took advantage of beta-hydroxybutyrate transport's temperature dependence and inhibition by phloretin and methylisobutylxanthine, all of which are demonstrated in this work. These properies suggested mediated transport, as did saturation kinetics and inhibition by several agents including pyruvate and alpha-cyanocinnamate. Most conclusive in this regard was a 2-fold preference for D- over L-beta-hydroxybutyrate. Entry was not Na+ dependent. It was stimulated by substitution of SO2-4 for most of the Cl-. The equilibrium beta-hydroxybutyrate space was much higher than the Cl- space of thymocytes, suggesting that beta-hydroxybutyrate entry is not associated with net inward negative current and is not coupled to outward Cl- or inward K+ movement (assuming that K+ is at elecrochemical equilibrium). Coupling to H+ entry or OH- exit is compatible with the result. These findings are consistent with beta-hydroxybutyrate entry by the carboxylate transport site which has been studied extensively with pyruvate and lactate as permeants. The Cl-/HCO-3 exchange carrier did not appear to contribute significantly to beta-hydroxybutyrate transport.",0,isolated avian hepatocytes (chick),in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"gluconeogenesis, no-change",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,hepatocyte,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Addition of 10 mM sorbitol, xylitol, or ethanol to the hepatocytes increased glucose production from pyruvate 25-40%, while glycerol addition increased it only 9%. 3. Addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate had no effect on glucose production from lactate or pyruvate. 4. Addition of octanoate had no effect on glucose production from pyruvate, but depressed it from lactate at 5 mM. 5. Differences in the formation of glucose from various substrates suggest some basic differences in the mode of glucose production between the chick and the rat and guinea-pig.",0,multiunit canine tracheal smooth muscle,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"excitation-contraction coupling, reversed",Ion & Nutrient Transport,tracheal smooth muscle,Upper airway,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
478182,Excitation-contraction coupling in multiunit tracheal smooth muscle during metabolic depletion: induction of rhythmicity.,"Multiunit canine tracheal smooth muscle responded to carbachol with graded depolarization and tonic contraction. The same concentration of carbachol, after metabolic depletion by substrate removal, produced rhythmic contractions and action potentials. Similar mechanical effects were also observed with acetylcholine or histamine. These effects were reversed by reintroducing glucose or beta-hydroxybutyrate, but not by 3-O-methylglucose, which is not metabolized; hence, the structural requirements for glucose, per se, or any osmotic effect were ruled out. Sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ was increased. A Ca2+-influx blocker, D-600, in low concentration (2 X 10(-8) M) abolished the rhythmic contractions without affecting the tonic contraction. Progressive metabolic depletion in presence of carbachol led to fluctuations in membrane potential with a crest of depolarization and appearance of action potentials, each of which resulted in a small contraction. Many of the small contractions partially fused to form the major rhythmic contractions which appeared at a frequency of one per minute. Rhythmicity could not be produced by increasing extracellular K+ concentration (20-120 mM) in presence of atropine (13(-7) M), but instead a tonic contraction occurred. These results suggest changes in excitation-contraction coupling mechanism with agonists like acetylcholine, carbachol, or histamine during substrate deprivation.",0,rabbit tibial nerve fascicle endoneurial preparation; rabbit sciatic nerve epineurial tissue,animal; in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal,"O2 uptake, no-change",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,endoneurial preparation,Peripheral nerves & ganglia (PNS),axons; Schwann cells,Neural / Glial,Neurons; Schwann cells (PNS),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic
596438,In vitro studies of the substrates for energy production and the effects of insulin on glucose utilization in the neural components of peripheral nerve.,"An ""endoneurial"" preparation from a rabbit tibial nerve fascicle was used to study the ability of peripheral nerve axons and Schwann cells to derive their composite energy requirements from glucose, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, or albumin-bound palmitate, and the effects of insulin in vitro on their composite glucose utilization. Samples incubated with 5 mM glucose for 2 h maintained a stable O2 uptake and P-creatine and ATP concentrations, and they exhibited a slight increase in P-creatine/creatine ratio (the electron microscopic appearance of the preparation was previously shown to be unaltered under these conditions). The rate of glucose oxidation required to account for the O2 uptake accounted for 61% of the glucose uptake. In samples incubated without substrate for 2 h, a marked fall in tissue glucose was associated with a 50% decrease in O2 uptake and with decreases in P-creatine, ATP, and in the P-creatine/creating ratio. In medium lacking glucose but containing 5 mM DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate, a stable rate of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate uptake was observed, and acetoacetate production accounted for only a small fraction; significant decreases in O2 uptake or ATP were prevented, and, although P-creatinde and the P-creatine/creatine ratio fell, they remained significantly higher than after incubation without substrate. An efficient blood-nerve barrier to albumin is known to exist. Medium containing albumin-bound palmitate with molar ratios or palmitate/albumin of 1 or 2 (highest FFA concentration, 1.32 meq/L) failed to prevent decreases in P-creatine, ATP, and in the P-creatine/creatine ratio during incubations without glucose; the associated O2 uptakes suggested that the tissue is susceptible to respiratory uncoupling and depression son exposure to albumin-blund palmitate as compared with non-neural tissue. Insulin (100 or 1000 microU/ml) had no detectable effects on glucose utilization in the endoneurial preparation during 2-h incubations with 5 mM glucose or (U-14C) glucose. In contrast, in epineurial tissue from rabbit sciatic nerve, insulin (100 micronU/ml) increased (U-14C) glucose incorporation into CO2 and total lipid. The neural components of peripheral nerve are probably dependent on glucose as their major substrate for energy production and respiration under most physiologic conditions in which elevated plasma ketone body concentrations are absent; their composite glucose utilization is not subject to acute, direct regulation by insulin in concentrations that might reasonably be derived from plasma insulin of pancreatic origin.",0,rat (day 20 gestation); placentas; fetal liver; fetal brain,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"oxidation of glucose and lactate, down",Metabolic Regulation,placenta,Placenta/Decidua,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Placentas and portions of fetal liver and brain from fed and 48-h fasted mothers were incubated in vitro with artificial mixtures containing glucose, lactate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate in concentrations simulating those that obtain in fed or 48-h fasted animals in vivo. Oxidative contributions from individual components were evaluated by separate incubations in which only one of the three fuels was 14C-labeled. As judged by the evolution of 14CO2, rates of oxidation of individual fuels by tissues of the conceptus appeared to be conditioned by ambient fuel concentrations rather than the dietary status of the mother. Additional studies indicated that evolution of 14CO2 from glucose or lactate may be depressed directly by adding beta-hydroxybutyrate to the incubation medium. This substitutive property of beta-hydroxybutyrate may ""spare"" glucose and lactate within the placenta for transfer to the fetus and preserve glucose and lactate availability for biosynthetic rather than oxidative disposition within the fetus.",GLUD1,acidotic dogs; normal dogs,animal; in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal,"net flux through glutamate dehydrogenase reaction, down",Metabolic Regulation,renal cortex,Kidney,kidney tubules,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
627477,"Relationship between the renal metabolism of glutamine, fatty acids and ketone bodies.","Using renal cortical slices from acidotic and normal dogs we show that fatty acids such as crotonate, octanoate, palmitate and oleate as well as ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) in concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 mM induce a 30 to 50% decrease in glutamine uptake and ammonia production when glutamine (1 mM) is used as the basic substrate. Glucose production also decreases by 20 to 30%. Glutamate release in the incubation medium is significantly augmented by fatty acids or ketones. When glutamate 5 mM is used as substrate instead of glutamine, glutamate uptake, ammoniagenesis and glucose production are significantly depressed by fatty acids and ketones. Increased glutamate release from glutamine, decreased glutamate uptake and decreased gluconeogenesis from glutamine or glutamate provide evidence that ketone bodies and fatty acids depress the net flux through the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction invovled in glutamine metabolism. This is further supported by the fact that addition of ketones to alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia stimulates net glutamate synthesis by kidney tubules.",0,dogs,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"aerobic metabolism, down",Metabolic Regulation,kidney,Kidney,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Unilateral ureteral obstruction,Renal & Urological,"NS, nan","NS, nan",infused,NS,NS

The animals were then anesthetized, and the kidneys rapidly excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen. While maintained at temperatures below -60 C, the frozen kidneys were separated into cortical and medullary fractions. The concentrations of alpha-ketoglutarate, glutamate, lactate, pyruvate, citrate, and malate were determined in both cortical and medullary renal tissue. The induction of reversible renal damage by 2 weeks of obstruction was associated with decreased ability to accumulate alpha-ketoglutarate after alpha-ketoglutarate and/or beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion. The induction of irreversible renal damage by 6 weeks of obstruction was associated with the inability to produce or accumulate (i) alpha-ketoglutarate, (ii) lactate, (iii) citrate, or (iv) malate after infusion of alpha-ketoglutarate and/or beta-hydroxybutyrate. The metabolic changes induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction indicatr that aerobic metabolism is inhibited with the virtual elimination of many aerobic reacions in the irreversibly damaged kidney.

Infusions of glucose or mannose abolished this effect, whereas equimolar fructose solutions did not affect 2-DG-induced feeding. Similar results were obtained when 2-DG and the hexoses were administered into the hepatic portal vein. These findings suggest that 2-DG elicits feeding due to glucoprivation at a site that is inaccessible to fructose. This site is likely to be in the brain, not the liver, because all three sugars can nourish peripheral tissue but only fructose cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, 2-DG-induced feeding was abolished by intravenous infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate, a substrate that can be oxidized by brain and other tissues but not by the liver.",0,three new cases; one patient studied in detail; eight other patients,human,NS; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,skeletal muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency,Metabolic & Endocrine,"mylagias and weakness, down","Muscle weakness, down",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

These attacks are especially likely to occur during prolonged exercise after fasting, eating a high-fat diet, or during cold weather. Occasionally after fasting alone, spontaneous muscle breakdown may occur. One patient studied in detail was excessively slow in producing ketones when he fasted. His mylagias and weakness appeared to be alleviated by beta-hydroxybutyrate. Of eight other patients thought to have idiopathic recurrent myoglobinuria, three were found to have myophosphorylase deficiency, whereas five did not have deficiency of either enzyme.

The time course of the incorporation of DL-beta-[3-14C]hydroxybutyrate into fetal lipids was studied. Lipid extracts of brown adipose tissue exhibited the greatest relative incorporation followed by pancreas, liver and lung. Less radioactivity was incorporated into brain and placenta. The incorporation into fetal lipids was several-fold greater than into maternal lipids. The labelling of the individual phospholipids was similar in the different tissues with phosphatidylcholine accounting for more than 50%. 75% of the radioactivity in brown adipose tissue was in the triacylglycerol fraction. In brain, liver and placenta, approximately half of the neutral lipid radioactivity was in cholesterol. Experiments in which D-beta-[3-14C]hydroxybutyrate was directly injected into fetuses in utero confirmed that this substrate was directly used by the fetuses without maternal intervention.

Eighteen children maintained on the MCT diet for 3 months to 4 years failed to show elevations of serum cholesterol and had only a slight rise in serum total fatty acids, in contrast to the marked hyperlipidemia observed in children on the standard high fat diet. Long term use of the MCT diet did not affect pH of venous blood.

An additional group of healthy controls received intravenous glucose (50 gm.) or glucose and insulin during the ketone infusion to determine the effect of hyperinsulinemia on ketone removal. Following ketone infusion, total blood ketone levels in the diabetics were twofold greater than in controls (p less than 0.001). The metabolic clearance rate of ketones (MCRk) in the diabetics was reduced by 42% from that of controls (p less than 0.001). In contrast, the calculated production rate of ketones (PRk) in diabetics was not consistently different from that observed in controls. In diabetics with normal PRk, MCRk remained significantly below control values (p less than 0.001). The ketone infusion resulted in a fall in plasma glucose and alanine levels in the normals as well as diabetics. However, the decline in plasma glucose induced by the ketone infusion was five- to sixfold greater in the diabetics than in controls (p less than 0.005) and correlated linearly with the decline in plasma alanine (p less than 0.02). Administration of intravenous glucose during an ongoing ketone infusion in normal subjects resulted in 37 +/- 5% reduction in beta-hydroxybutyrate, but no change in acetoacetate concentration. The decline in beta-hydroxybutyrate was two- to threefold greater than would be expected if glucose had acted solely to inhibit endogenous ketone production. Similar results were observed when hyperinsulinemia without hyperglycemia was produced by simultaneous administration of insulin and glucose. It is concluded that (1) ketone disposal is reduced in diabetes even when ketone production is normal, suggesting the rate of ketone utilization may be a more sensitive index of insulin deficiency than is ketone production; (2) hyperinsulinemia stimulates beta-hydroxybutyrate utilization without influencing acetoacetate concentration; and (3) increased blood ketone levels induced by infusion of Na DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate reduce plasma glucose and alanine concentrations in diabetes. These findings thus support a role for insulin in influencing ketone disposal in normal as well as diabetic man and a role for ketones in influencing substrate availability for gluconeogenesis in diabetes.",0; GLUL,Azotobacter vinelandii batch cultures,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"rising oxygen tension, up",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,NS,NS,Azotobacter vinelandii,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",0.2% beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Glutamate dehydrogenase activities were low during the whole culture cycle, indicating that ammonia assimilation proceeds via glutamine. Toward depletion of sucrose or during induction of encystment, slight secretion of ammonia with subsequent reabsorption was occasionally observed, whereas massive ammonia excretion occurred when the sulfate became exhausted. The extracellular ammonia levels were paralleled by changes in the glutamine synthetase activity. The inactivation of the nitrogenase is explained as a result of rising oxygen tension, a consequence of a metabolic shift-down (reduced respiration) that occurs in organisms entering the stationary phase.",0,isolated white adipocytes from fasted rats,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"peripheral FFA mobilization, down",Metabolic Regulation,white adipocytes,Adipose tissue,white adipocytes,Adipose,White adipocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"free fatty acid release, down; glycerol release, no-change","Free fatty acids, down; Glycerol release, no-change","D,L-beta-hydroxybutyrate",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

As this ""in vitro"" lowering effect on FFA release was observed using concentrations occurring ""in vivo"" in the blood for lactate, beta-hydrobutyrate, and alanine, these results suggest that, besides lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, alanine may also assume an important role in the ""in vivo"" regulation of peripheral FFA mobilization and consequently of ketogenesis.",0,large omentum adipose tissue,in vitro,Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"lipolysis, down",Metabolic Regulation,large omentum adipose tissue,Adipose tissue,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

The stimulation increased sharply within the range of 1-10 mug epinephrine per ml and reached a maximum at 10 mug/ml. The incorporation of glucose and acetate into fatty acids and that of glucose into glycerol decreased with increasing concentration of epinephrine in the incubation medium. In the absence of glucose and acetate in the incubation medium, hydroxybutyrate at concentrations within 0.96-96 mM decreased significantly either the spontaneous lipolysis or that stimulated by epinephrine. In the presence of 2.5 mM glucose and 5 mM acetate in the incubation medium, beta-hydroxybutyrate did not significantly inhibit the mobilization of NEFA stimulated by epinephrine even at a concentration of 96 mM. In contrast, it accentuated the effect of epinephrine on the decrease of synthesis of fatty acids de novo and on the increase of reesterification of fatty acids. These results indicate that glucose and acetate may counteract the inhibitory effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate on lipolysis.",0; INS; GCG,nonobese subjects; obese subjects (postabsorptive); obese subjects after 3 days starvation; obese subjects after 3-5 1/2 wk starvation; obese subjects fasted 5-10 wk,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Multi-model,"nitrogen conservation, up",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Starvation,Metabolic & Endocrine,"protein catabolism, down","Protein catabolism, down",Na dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

An additional obese group received 12-h ketone infusions on 2 consecutive days after 5-10 wk of fasting. The ketone infusion in nonobese and obese subjects studied in the postabsorptive state resulted in total blood ketone acid levels of 1.1-1.2 mM, a 5-15 mg/100 ml decrease in plasma glucose, and unchanged levels of insulin, glucagon, lactate, and pyruvate. Plasma alanine fell by 21% (P smaller than 0.001) in 3 h. In contrast, other amino acids were stable or varied by less than 10%. Infusions lasting 6 h reduced plasma alanine by 37%, reaching levels comparable to those observed in prolonged starvation. Equimolar infusions of NaC1 and/or administration of NaHCO3 failed to alter plasma alanine levels. During prolonged fasting, plasma alanine, which had fallen by 40% below prefast levels, fell an additional 30% in response to the ketone infusion. In association with repeated prolonged (12 h) infusions in subjects fasted 5-10 wk, urinary nitrogen excretion fell by 30%, returning to base line after cessation of theinfusions and paralleling the changes in plasma alanine. Ketone infusins resulted in two- to fourfold greater increments in blood ketone acids in fasted as compared to postabsorptive subjects. It is concluded that increased blood ketone acid levels induced by infusions of Na DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate result in hypoalaninemia and in nitrogen conservation in starvation. These data suggest that hyperketonemia may be a contributory factor in the decreased availability or circulating alanine and reduction in protein catabolism characteristic of prolonged fastings9",ARG1,isolated hepatocytes from fasted rats,animal; in vitro,Multi-model,"urea formation, up",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,hepatocytes,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,mitochondrial membrane,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
1183622,Role of anion translocation across the mitochondrial membrane in the regulation of urea synthesis from ammonia by isolated rat hepatocytes.,"The regulation of urea synthesis from ammonia was investigated using isolated hepatocytes from fasted rats. Addition of ammonia alone produced only a small increase of urea formation, which was stimulated 2-fold by ornithine in conjunction with a fall of ATP levels and an accumulation of citrulline. Further addition of oleate or beta-hydroxybutyrate produced an additional 2-fold stimulation of urea formation to approximately 200 mumol/g dry weight/hour. The presence of oleate also protected against the inhibitory effect of 2,4-dinitrophenol on urea synthesis and the cellular ATP content. The data suggest that both the rate of of energy production and the rate of generation of reducing equivalents from endogensou substrates are insufficient to meet the requirements for optimal rates of urea synthesis. Urea formation from NH3 in the presence of ornithine and oleate, but iin the absence of gluconeogenic precursors, was inhibited by butylmalonate, a known inhibitor of malate-phosphate exchange across the mitochondrial membrane, and stimulated by theaddition of malate and other dicarboxylic acids and amino acids to the cell suspension...",0,young growing rats; chicks; pigs,animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Other Mammal,"glycolytic rate, down",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"fatty acid synthesis, down","Fatty acid synthesis, down","1,3-butanediol (BD)","1,3-Butanediol (BD)",NS

Replacement of up to 20% of the dietary carbohydrate energy with BD did not affect body weight gain or food efficiency in these species. Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were markedly elevated when BD was added to the diet. Plasma triglyceride response varied with species. In the rat, plasma triglyceride levels were decreased when BD was added to a high-carbohydrate diet. Plasma triglyceride levels were increased when BD-containing diets were fed to pigs and unchanged when chicks consumed diets containing BD. The hepatic lactate:pyruvate ratio was increased in rats fed BD and decreased in chicks fed BD. Hepatic long-chain acyl CoA levels were increased in rats, but not in chicks, fed BD. Addition of BD to a high-carbohydrate diet markedly decreased the rate of fatty acid synthesis, as measured in vitro or in vivo, in rat liver but not in rat or pig adipose tissue. Hepatic fatty acid synthesis in the chick was not affected by replacement of up to 18% of the dietary carbohydrate with BD. We propose that the hepatic conversion of BD to beta-hydroxybutyrate in the rat shifts the cytoplasmic redox state, reduces the glycolytic rate, and reduces substrate availability for fatty acid synthesis. Further, the concomitant shift in the mitochondrial redox state allows long-chain acyl CoA levels to increase. The overall effect is a decrease in the rate of fatty acid synthesis in livers of rats fed BD.",0,isolated perfused rabbit hearts,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"tissue redox state, more reduced",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"deleterious effects, increase","Adverse effects, increase",perfusate,NS,NS

The perfusate lactate to pyruvate ratio was shown to accurately represent the tissue ratio. The intracellular redox state varied independently of changes in substrate uptake. Increasing perfusate beta-HB concentration caused increased beta-HB uptake, decreased lactate uptake, and unchanged glucose uptake. Decreased perfusate oxygen tension caused inhibition of lactate and beta-HB uptakes and, when exteme, caused increased glucose uptake. The combination of a modest reduction in oxygen tension and increased perfusate beta-HB concentration caused a more reduced environment in the tissue than either change by itself.

Permeability of the D isomer exceeded that of the L isomer. Permeability of either isomer rose throughout suckling (sevenfold) and declined after weaning to the low, newborn values. This age dependence differed markedly from those of cerebral blood flow and cerebral permeabilities of urea, glucose, valine, leucine, and DMO (5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione). Fat-feeding more than doubled cerebral betaHB permeability without significantly affecting cerebral blood flow or the permeabilities of urea, glucose, and DMO. Temperature dependence of betaHB permeability was similar to that of glucose transport. The age and diet dependence of betaHB were not accounted for in terms of body temperature, capillary surface, capillary porosity, or plasma proton concentration. A modulable betaHB carrier seemed indicated. Utilization of betaHB by the brain was signficantly governed by permeability, hence the increased permeability in ketotoc states should contribute to glucose sparing and eventually to protein sparing.",0,normal postabsorptive volunteers; LCT (6 subjects); MCT-LCT (6 subjects); D-beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion (6 subjects); saline (4 subjects),human,Human – Interventional; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"ketone body mediation, no-change",Metabolic Regulation,whole body,Systemic/Whole organism,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"leucine oxidation, no-change","Leucine oxidation, no-change",D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (540 mumol.kg-1.h-1),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

To assess this problem, we studied whole body leucine metabolism, using L-[1-13C]leucine in normal postabsorptive volunteers who received either long-chain triglycerides (LCT, 0.15 g.kg-1.h-1, 6 subjects), a 50-50 mixture of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and LCT (0.15 g.kg-1.h-1, 6 subjects), D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (540 mumol.kg-1.h-1, 6 subjects), or saline (4 subjects). Leucine concentration decreased only with MCT-LCT. Leucine flux decreased by 10-20% from basal in all groups. Leucine oxidation, which was corrected for the contribution to 13CO2 of the 13C natural abundance of the infused substrates, decreased during LCT infusion (0.31 +/- 0.02 to 0.24 +/- 0.01 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01), but was unaffected by MCT-LCT (despite plasma free fatty acid levels similar to those obtained with LCT), D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, or saline infusion. Therefore, 1) the effect of fatty acids on amino acid oxidation is not mediated by ketone bodies, 2) it depends on the fatty acid chain length, 3) long-chain fatty acids but not medium-chain fatty acids could play a protein-sparing role during parenteral nutrition.",0,rats subjected to forced alcoholization for 5.5 days,animal,Animal – Rat,"heart contractility depression, up",Vascular Function & Angiogenesis,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Postintoxication heart injury,Toxicology / Poisoning,"heart contractility, down","Cardiac function, down",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

A positive correlation was discovered between depression of left ventricular contractility and the blood content of acetaldehyde and ketone bodies. The magnitude of the threshold of heart fibrillation did not correlate well with the concentration of ethanol during alcoholization. However, it agreed well with ethanol concentration in the postintoxication period. Additional administration to the animals of beta-hydroxybutyrate or caprylic acid in the postintoxication period intensified heart contractility depression. The conclusion is drawn that elimination of ketosis in ethanol withdrawal as well as a progressive taking out of alcoholic patients from dipsomania can prevent the development or attenuate the intensity of postintoxication heart injury.",0,normal postabsorptive subjects,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"plasma free fatty acids, down",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"glucose concentration, down","Blood glucose, down",D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-beta-OHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

Plasma insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon concentrations were unchanged in all groups. LCT and MCT/LCT infusions increased levels of plasma free fatty acids (FFA) compared with those of the saline group, whereas D-beta-OHB decreased them. Plasma ketone body concentrations were higher during the D-beta-OHB and triglyceride infusions than during the saline test. Glucose concentrations and appearance (Ra) and disappearance (Rd) rates were not modified during saline infusion. Glucose levels decreased only in the D-beta-OHB and MCT/LCT groups (P < .05), whereas they were unchanged during LCT infusion. Glucose Ra decreased slightly by 15% to 17% in LCT, MCT/LCT, and D-beta-OHB groups (P < .05 v saline). Glucose Rd decreased by 14% to 16% in each lipid-infusion group (P < .05 v saline). Glucose clearance rates decreased by 14% only in the LCT group (P < .001). Glucose oxidation rates did not change significantly during the lipid substrate infusions compared with saline infusion. In conclusion, (1) the effects of fatty acids on glucose metabolism appear to depend on the fatty acid chain length, since only LCT infusion significantly impaired glucose utilization; and (2) in subjects with normal endocrine pancreas function, we found no adverse effects of a short-term increase in lipid substrate availability on glucose production rate and concentration.",0,rat embryos; diabetic rat serum; normal rat serum,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"uptake, no-change",Ion & Nutrient Transport,embryo,Systemic/Whole organism,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetic pregnancy,Reproductive & Pregnancy,"somatic malformations, up","Somatic malformations, up",supplemented in culture medium,In vitro media supplementation,NS
1465055,Development of rat embryos in culture media containing different concentrations of normal and diabetic rat serum.,"In vitro culture of rodent embryos has been extensively used in the search for teratologic agents, with possible relevance to diabetic pregnancy. However, the high concentrations of rat serum added to the culture medium (approximately 75%) have raised concern that the teratogenic effects of some compounds may be attenuated or masked in this culture system and thereby forced the addition of pharmacological concentrations of the compounds (e.g., D-glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate) to the medium. This issue has been examined in the present study where the effects of different concentrations of rat serum on growth and differentiation of rat embryos were recorded in cultures supplemented with increased concentrations of D-glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate. The embryonic development was also evaluated after culture in medium supplied with serum from diabetic rats. Compared with normal rat serum, the diabetic serum had an elevated glucose concentration as well as markedly increased levels of triglycerides and branched amino acids, indicating a potentially rich supply of major nutrients for the cultured embryos. Lowering the serum concentration in the culture medium from 80% to 50% yielded progressively retarded embryonic growth but no increased rate of other morphological malformations. At 40% serum concentration, however, there was a sharp rise in the incidence of somatic malformations, in addition to the prevailing growth retardation. When the embryonic growth and development were compared at 50% and 80% serum concentrations, increased D-glucose or beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations caused similar degrees of embryonic dysmorphogenesis. Also, the uptake of each compound by the embryos exposed to elevated levels of the two agents were similar in 50% and 80% serum cultures. There was, therefore, no protection against the teratogenic and growth-retarding effects of increased D-glucose or beta-hydroxybutyrate offered by high serum concentrations in the culture medium (i.e., 80% vs. 50%). Embryos cultured in 50% or 80% diabetic rat serum at 30 mmol/L or 50 mmol/L D-glucose concentration showed similar rates of somatic malformations as did embryos exposed to the same proportion of normal rat serum at similar glucose concentrations. By contrast, the diabetic rat serum amplified the general retarding effects of high D-glucose levels, yielding lower protein levels and somite numbers in embryos from diabetic serum culture than in embryos cultured in normal rat serum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0,acutely uremic rats; starved acutely uremic rats; sham-operated controls; bilaterally nephrectomized rats; isolated liver cells; hepatocytes,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Animal – Other Mammal; In vitro – Primary cells,"ureagenesis, down",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,hepatocyte,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Uremia,Renal & Urological,"urea production, down","Urea production, down",NS,NS,NS

Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels of starved acutely uremic rats were reduced compared to starved sham-operated controls, suggesting a failure to develop hyperketonemia. On the other hand, beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration is elevated in the liver. Hepatocyte beta-hydroxybutyrate production of acutely uremic animals is enhanced using serine as a substrate. Addition of ketone bodies abolishes this effect. Blood acetoacetate levels of starved acutely uremic rats are elevated compared to sham-operated controls. Liver acetoacetate concentration is unchanged in acute uremia. Hepatocyte acetoacetate production of acutely uremic rats is stimulated using serine and alanine as substrates. Again, this effect is reversed by addition of ketone bodies. Addition of ketone bodies does not affect enhanced glucose production from serine or alanine in hepatocytes of acutely uremic rats but decreases markedly enhanced urea production from serine (156 +/- 35.2 versus 27.4 +/- 7.1) and alanine (80.0 +/- 22.3 versus 42.0 +/- 4.4 nmol mg-1. 30 min-1), especially after bilateral nephrectomy. The data show that the two processes of gluconeogenesis and ureagenesis can be dissociated in hepatocytes of bilaterally nephrectomized rats by the addition of ketone bodies.

1536251,Epinephrine's ketogenic effect in humans is mediated principally by lipolysis.,"To quantify epinephrine's effects on acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate kinetics, we infused subjects with 0.3 and 2.5 micrograms/min epinephrine, either alone or with a concomitant somatostatin infusion with insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone replaced at postabsorptive levels (islet clamp). Additional subjects received no epinephrine but sequential infusions of heparin plus 10% Intralipid at rates of 0.5 and 3.0 ml/min. Both epinephrine and Intralipid increased ketone body appearance (unaffected by islet clamp), augmented the interconversion rates between ketone bodies and, during the 2.5 micrograms/min infusion, caused a marked increase in beta-hydroxybutyrate appearance. The fraction of plasma free fatty acid (FFA) flux appearing as plasma ketones increased from 6 to 7% in the basal state to 11% at the high-epinephrine infusion. This fraction was also unaffected by the islet clamp and was not different from values obtained at similar Intralipid plus heparin-induced elevations in plasma FFA levels. We conclude that epinephrine's ketogenic effect in humans is primarily the result of its lipolytic effect, is accompanied by a significantly increased rate of ketone body interconversion, is manifest largely as an increase in plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate appearance at high plasma epinephrine values, and is not limited by portal insulin at post-absorptive levels.",0,chronically catheterized fetal sheep,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"uptake, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,fetal hind limb,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Maternal starvation,Reproductive & Pregnancy,"lactate production, up; hind limb oxygen consumption, up; fetal arterial oxygen content, down","Lactate production, up; Oxygen consumption, up; Oxygen delivery, down",2 hour infusion,NS,NS

Specifically, we aimed to determine whether beta-hydroxybutyrate was taken up by fetal muscle and whether lactate production by the fetal hind limb contributed to the raised circulating lactate levels seen in high ketone states. STUDY DESIGN: Hind limb metabolism was studied in 10 chronically catheterized fetal sheep. Substrate/oxygen quotients were measured before and after 2 hour infusions of beta-hydroxybutyrate and compared with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: beta-Hydroxybutyrate was taken up by hind limb tissues in large amounts (butyrate/oxygen quotient = 1.02 +/- 0.40). Lactate was produced by the hind limb (lactate/oxygen quotient = -0.96 +/- 0.52) in amounts almost equivalent to glucose uptake (glucose/oxygen quotient = 1.32 +/- 0.29). Hind limb oxygen consumption increased 35% and fetal arterial oxygen content fell 16%. CONCLUSION: beta-Hydroxybutyrate may be consumed by the fetal carcass in amounts sufficient to entirely substitute for glucose. Glucose may then be released as lactate for metabolism elsewhere.

To determine whether hypoglycemia is protective or deleterious to the perinatal brain subjected to hypoxia-ischemia, 7-d postnatal rats were rendered hypoglycemic either by receiving an s.c. injection of insulin or fasting for 12 h. All rat pups underwent unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by exposure to 8% oxygen-balance nitrogen at 37 degrees C for 2 h. Control animals (no insulin or fasting) received s.c. injections of normal saline. Mean blood glucose concentrations were 5.4 +/- 0.1, 4.3 +/- 0.2, and 3.4 +/- 0.1 mmol/L for control, insulin, and fasted animals, respectively. Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were identical (0.5 +/- 0.1 mmol/L) for control and insulin-treated animals, but more than doubled in concentration in the fasted animals (p less than 0.001). Mortality rates during hypoxia-ischemia were higher in the insulin-treated animals (30%) than in either the fasted (4%) or control (0%) animals (p less than 0.05). Fasted animals showed a significant reduction in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage as compared with either the insulin-treated or control animals. Insulin-treated animals were not significantly different from controls. The findings indicate that 1) insulin induced hypoglycemia does not provide a protective effect on perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage, as in adults; and 2) fasting adequate to produce hypoglycemia and ketonemia improved neuropathologic outcome.",0,young Wistar rat,animal,Animal – Rat,"fractional reabsorption, down",Ion & Nutrient Transport,nephron,Kidney,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",endogenous plasma ketone body concentration,NS,NS

The concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) and acetoacetate (AcAc) in plasma, tubular fluid and urine was measured by an ultramicromethod using enzymatic cycling. At endogenous plasma ketone body concentration, approximately 80% of the filtered load of beta-HB and AcAc was reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule, the remaining fraction being almost completely reabsorbed between the late proximal convoluted and the distal tubule; under these conditions, the urinary excretion of ketone bodies was less than 1% of the filtered load. A progressive elevation to steady-state levels of plasma beta-HB resulted in a progressive reduction of the fractional reabsorption of beta-HB and AcAc in the proximal convoluted tubule, which means that reabsorption of ketone bodies in this nephron segment is saturable. No net secretion of ketone bodies could be demonstrated along the nephron even at the highest plasma ketone body concentrations reached. In clearance experiments, the capacity of the rat kidney for reabsorbing both beta-HB and AcAc was found to be limited by a maximal tubular capacity (Tm). The data suggest that, in the young Wistar rat nephron, most of the reabsorption of ketone bodies is carrier mediated.",0,human endothelial cell monolayers,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"energy deficiency, up",Metabolic Regulation,endothelium,Vasculature,human endothelial cell,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketone body (beta-hydroxybutyrate),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
1653662,Effect of hypoxia upon intracellular calcium concentration of human endothelial cells.,"Ischemia is a situation occurring in several diseases including myocardial infarction and organ transplantation in which oxygenated blood supply is impaired. Ischemia leads to many cellular and tissue modifications, the most important one being cell death. Several explanations have been proposed to account for these modifications and cell death; among them is calcium overload. However, the influence of calcium concentration on the alteration of endothelial cell functions or viability during ischemia are still unknown. We developed here an in vitro model where human endothelial cell monolayers were submitted to hypoxia with or without reoxygenation and variation in calcium concentration was followed using a specific intracellular probe Fura 2. We observed a significant increase of [Ca2+]i during 2 h hypoxia reaching values similar to those observed during agonist stimulation of endothelial cells but far lower than values toxic for the cells. This increase was constant during the hypoxic incubation and was due mainly to an influx of extracellular calcium. Viability was also followed during hypoxia and using calcium channel blockers, we could show that there was no correlation between viability and the rise in calcium concentration. During the reoxygenation period, [Ca2+]i decreased to reach the normal value of resting cells after 45 min, suggesting that cells were still able to recover their calcium homeostasis. The use of a ketone body (beta-hydroxybutyrate) indicated that an energy deficiency was responsible for the hypoxia-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. We actually observed a 43% decrease in ATP concentration after 2 h hypoxia. This decrease was already significant after 30 min which thus precedes the changes in [Ca2+]i. These results show that during hypoxia, energy deficiency led to an increase in [Ca2+]i which is, however, too low to account for the loss of viability but which is within the range of concentrations observed during stimulation of endothelial cells. We propose that such increased intracellular calcium concentrations could play a role in the synthesis of mediators leading to the development of local inflammation.",PNMT; 0; GH1; GCG,six healthy subjects,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"nervous tissue ketone metabolism, NS",Metabolic Regulation,nervous tissue,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypoglycemia,Metabolic & Endocrine,"neurohumoral responses to hypoglycaemia, down","Blood glucose, down",infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate (3 mg min-1 kg-1 body weight),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
1696304,Ketone infusion lowers hormonal responses to hypoglycaemia: evidence for acute cerebral utilization of a non-glucose fuel.,"1. The effect of hyperketonaemia on counter-regulatory hormone responses to hypoglycaemia has been examined in six healthy subjects. 2. A controlled, step-wise reduction in blood glucose concentration was achieved by adjusting the rate of glucose infusion during a primed-continuous infusion of soluble insulin (1.5 m-units min-1 kg-1 body weight, plasma insulin concentration approximately 90 m-units/l). Simultaneous infusion of either saline or beta-hydroxybutyrate (3 mg min-1 kg-1 body weight) was administered in a single-blind fashion, in random order. Despite a need for 40% more glucose during the ketone infusion, an identical fall in blood glucose concentration was achieved in each study. 3. The glycaemic threshold for stimulating an adrenaline response of 0.41 nmol/l was reduced from 3.1 to 2.8 mmol/l (P less than 0.05) during ketone infusion, and that for stimulating a response of more than 50% of basal from 3.6 to 3.1 mmol/l (P less than 0.001). The peak adrenaline response fell from 7.97 to 2.6 nmol/l (P less than 0.04). Peak noradrenaline, cortisol and growth hormone responses were also significantly lower during ketone infusion (P = 0.04, 0.001 and 0.006, respectively). Glucagon responses alone were unaffected by hyperketonaemia. 4. The provision of an alternate metabolic fuel thus produced immediate changes in the neurohumoral responses to hypoglycaemia. This is consistent with the hypothesis that human nervous tissue can metabolize ketones acutely.",0,freshly isolated porcine islets,animal; in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal,"initiation of insulin release, up; potentiation of insulin release, no-change",Hormonal Regulation; Hormonal Regulation,porcine islets,Pancreas,porcine islet cells,Pancreatic Endocrine,Islet cells (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate (10 mmol/l),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
1713820,Immunological and insulin secretory studies on isolated porcine islets of Langerhans.,"Since porcine islets are considered a likely tissue source for islet transplantation we have studied the insulin secretory responses to stimuli and some of the cell surface antigen characteristics of porcine islet cells. In a static incubation system, the threshold level of glucose required for the stimulation of insulin secretion from freshly isolated porcine islets was found to be between 2.8 and 4.2 mmol glucose/l. Arginine (5 mmol/l) and 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (1 mmol/l) potentiated insulin release induced by 8.3 mmol glucose/l. Leucine (5 mmol/l) initiated release in the presence of 2 mmol glucose/l. Neither beta-hydroxybutyrate (10 mmol/l) nor octanoate (5 mmol/l) potentiated insulin release induced by 8.3 mmol glucose/l, but beta-hydroxybutyrate initiated release in the presence of 2 mmol glucose/l while octanoate did not. A 125I-labelled protein A binding assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system were used to detect antibody binding to islet and non-islet cells. Monoclonal antibodies raised against intact rat islets were shown to bind to both porcine and rat islet cells but not to rat hepatoma tissue culture cells or rat insulinoma cells. The serum from recently diagnosed type I diabetics was shown to bind to rat islet cells in a 125I-labelled protein A binding assay, while serum from control subjects showed little, if any, binding. Porcine islet cells were unable to distinguish between the sera of recently diagnosed type I diabetics and controls in a similar assay. In conclusion, porcine islets respond to many of the major insulin secretagogues to which human islets are sensitive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,opossum esophagus muscle strips,animal,Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"substrate utilization, NS",Metabolic Regulation,esophageal muscle,Esophagus,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
1727653,Paradoxical relationship between substrates and agonist-induced contractions of opossum esophageal body and sphincter in vitro.,"Possible differences in the abilities of esophageal body and lower esophageal sphincter muscles to utilize substrates to support agonist-induced contractions were studied. Strips of longitudinal, circular, and lower esophageal sphincter muscle from the opossum esophagus were first contracted to approximately 70% of the maximal contraction elicited by acetylcholine, histamine, or substance P. The tissues were then exhausted by exposure to 5 x 10(-4) M carbachol and a 15% O2-5% CO2-80% N2 gas mixture for 90 min. They were next reequilibrated with one of a number of alternative substrates and 95% O2-5% CO2 for 3 hr. Responses to the initial agonist doses were again noted and compared to controls. The alternative substrates were: 2-deoxyglucose, glucose, fructose 1-6 diphosphate, pyruvate, lactate, acetate, butyrate, caprylate, histidine, leucine, aspartate, alanine, succinate, acetoacetone, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. The results obtained show qualitative differences in the ability of the three muscle types to use these substrates. More importantly, however, the ability of any one substrate to support contractions was a function of the agonist used to stimulate the muscle. The evidence suggests, therefore, that not all pharmacologic receptors have equal access to intracellular energy sources.",PDHA1; NNT; 0,NS,NS,NS,"mitochondrial NAD system reduction, down",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"gluconeogenesis, up","Gluconeogenesis, up",NS,NS,NS
1734029,Role of endogenous fatty acids in the control of hepatic gluconeogenesis.,"Inhibition of endogenous long chain fatty acids oxidation by tetradecylglycidate (TDGA) impeded gluconeogenesis from lactate or from low concentrations of pyruvate (less than 0.5 mM). The inhibitory effect of TDGA was overcome by medium and short chain fatty acid or by concentrations of pyruvate about 0.5 mM, but not by 10-fold higher concentrations of lactate. Despite decreased energy demand when gluconeogenesis was inhibited by TDGA, the pyruvate-induced increase in hepatic oxygen consumption was similar to the control, indicating that pyruvate transport across the mitochondrial membrane and/or its decarboxylation was not altered, and therefore can not be responsible for the inhibition of gluconeogenesis. Neither does a deficiency of acetyl-CoA explain the decrease in the gluconeogenic flux since high pyruvate loads (greater than 0.5 mM), beta-hydroxybutyrate or even ethanol was capable of overcoming the inhibitory effect of TDGA in the absence of significant changes in the hepatic content of acetyl-CoA. At low (less than 0.3 mM), presumably physiological, pyruvate concentrations, its rate of mitochondrial utilization is limited by the activity of the monocarboxylate transporter. Agents that reduced the mitochondrial NAD system, and therefore reduced flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase, like beta-hydroxybutyrate or ethanol, stimulated gluconeogenesis when fatty acid oxidation was inhibited. The latter observations indicate that the primary role of endogenous fatty acid, when substrate availability is limiting, is to spare mitochondrial pyruvate by decreasing its oxidation, and therefore shifting the partitioning between the carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions toward the former.",0,primary rabbit kidney proximal tubule cells,animal; in vitro,Multi-model,"cell growth, up","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",kidney,Kidney,proximal tubule cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
1860552,Growth and function of primary rabbit kidney proximal tubule cells in glucose-free serum-free medium.,"The properties of primary rabbit kidney proximal tubule cells in glucose-free serum-free medium have been examined. Primary rabbit kidney proximal tubule cells were observed to grow at the same rate, 1.0 doublings/day, both in glucose-free and in glucose-supplemented medium. Growth in glucose-free medium was dependent upon the presence of an additional nutritional supplement, such as glutamine, pyruvate, palmitate, lactate, or beta hydroxybutyrate. Lactate, pyruvate, and glutamate are utilized for renal gluconeogenesis in vivo. The growth of the primary rabbit kidney proximal tubule cells in glucose-free medium was also dependent upon the presence of the three growth supplements insulin, transferrin, and hydrocortisone. Insulin was growth stimulatory to the primary proximal tubule cells in glucose-free medium, although insulin causes a reduction in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity in these cells. PEPCK is a key regulatory enzyme in the gluconeogenic pathway. In order to evaluate whether or not the primary cells have gluconeogenic capacity, their glucose content was determined. The cells contained 5 pmoles D-glucose/mg protein. However, no significant glucose was detected in the medium. Presumably, the primary cells were either utilizing or storing the glucose made by the gluconeogenic pathway. Consistent with this latter possibility, cellular glycogen levels were observed to increase with time in culture. The effect of glucose on the expression of the alpha I(IV) collagen and laminin B1 chain genes was examined. Northern analysis indicated that the level of alpha I(IV) collagen mRNA was significantly elevated in glucose containing, as compared with glucose deficient, medium. In contrast, laminin B1 chain mRNA levels were not significantly affected by the glucose content of the medium.",IAPP,isolated perfused normal rat pancreas,animal,Animal – Rat,"amylin secretion, up",Hormonal Regulation,pancreas,Pancreas,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

The isolated perfused normal rat pancreas was used to evaluate the effects of glucose and insulin secretagogues, such as arginine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and gliclazide, on amylin secretion. Glucose and the other stimulants tested elicited a significant release of amylin from the rat pancreas in a biphasic pattern, similar to that of insulin. Dose-response studies of the glucose-induced release of amylin and insulin revealed that they possessed a similar dependency on glucose. However, the release of amylin induced by high concentrations of glucose was partially dissociated from that of insulin; that is, the amylin-insulin molar ratios induced by 22.2 and 33.3 mM glucose (1.11 +/- 0.05 and 1.05 +/- 0.04%, respectively) were significantly higher than those induced by 16.7 mM glucose (0.90 +/- 0.04%, P less than 0.01 vs. 22.2 mM glucose, P less than 0.05 vs. 33.3 mM glucose). Additionally, when the basal concentration of glucose in the perfusate was increased from 5.6 to 11.1 mM, the response of amylin was unchanged. These data suggest that amylin may be an islet hormone whose abundant response to high concentrations of glucose might contribute to the oversecretion of amylin in the hyperglycemia that accompanies diabetes mellitus.",0,mouse embryos; early somite stage,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; NS,"cell number, down",Other / Unspecified,cranial neuroepithelium,NS,cranial neuroepithelial cells,Neural / Glial,Neural stem/progenitors (NSC/NPC),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Anencephaly; Spina bifida,Genetic / Congenital,"neurological deficits, up","Neurological deficit score, up","medium containing 32 mmol/l D,L,-beta-hydroxybutyrate",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic
1881416,Recovery by mouse embryos following teratogenic exposure to ketosis.,"Previous studies have shown that the ketone body D,L,-beta-hydroxybutyrate was teratogenic to mouse embryos exposed in culture during the period of neurulation. Inhibition of closure of the cranial and caudal neuropores was the most frequently occurring defect and these abnormalities were thought to be the forerunner of anencephaly and spina bifida, respectively. However, additional studies demonstrated that embryos could recover morphologically from these effects if the ketone body was removed from the culture medium and if the recovery period was of sufficient duration. In an attempt to define further the phenomenon responsible for this recovery and to determine the extent of the recovery process, the present study examining the cross-sectional area, cell number, and mitotic index of cranial neuroepithelial cells was conducted in mouse embryos cultured from the early somite stage under one of the following conditions: 1) control medium for 60 h; 2) medium containing 32 mmol/l D,L,-beta-hydroxybutyrate for 24 h followed by culture in control medium for an additional 36 h (recovery group); 3) medium containing 32 mmol/l D,L,-beta-hydroxybutyrate for 60 h (continuously exposed group). The results indicate that although neural tube closure occurred in the recovery group, complete recovery was limited to the ventral regions of the forebrain and that the remainder of the prosencephalon as well as the rhombencephalon failed to undergo complete catch-up growth. Thus, cell numbers in these areas were approximately 70% of control values. Therefore, while the gross anatomical disturbances produced by the ketone body may be compensated for, histological alterations in the affected tissues remain. Ultimately, these data suggest that neurological deficits may be an outcome of ketone body exposure during the early stages of embryogenesis.",0,223 pregnant women: pregestational diabetes mellitus; gestational diabetes mellitus; normal carbohydrate metabolism,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"altered brain development in utero, down","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Gestational ketonemia,Metabolic & Endocrine,"mental-development-index (age 2), down; Stanford-Binet average (ages 3-5), down","Cognitive performance, down",plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
1890151,Correlations between antepartum maternal metabolism and intelligence of offspring.,"BACKGROUND: It is not clear to what extent maternal metabolism during pregnancy affects the cognitive and behavioral function of the offspring by altering brain development in utero. To investigate this question, we correlated measures of metabolism in pregnant diabetic and nondiabetic women with the intellectual development of their offspring. METHODS: The study included 223 pregnant women and their singleton offspring: 89 women had diabetes before pregnancy (pregestational diabetes mellitus), 99 had the onset of diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes mellitus), and 35 had normal carbohydrate metabolism during their pregnancy. We correlated measures of maternal glucose and lipid metabolism (fasting plasma glucose levels, hemoglobin A1c levels, episodes of hypoglycemia, episodes of acetonuria, and plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acid levels) with two measures of intellectual development in the offspring--the mental development index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, given at the age of two years, and the Stanford--Binet Intelligence Scale, given at the ages of three, four, and five years and expressed as an average of the three scores. RESULTS: After correction for socioeconomic status, race or ethnic origin, and patient group, the children's mental-development-index scores at the age of two years correlated inversely with the mothers' third-trimester plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (r = -0.21, P less than 0.01); the average Stanford-Binet scores correlated inversely with third-trimester plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (r = -0.20, P less than 0.02) and free fatty acid (r = -0.27, P less than 0.002) levels. No other correlations were significant. Including various perinatal events (e.g., prematurity and acidemia) in the analyses did not alter the results. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal diabetes during pregnancy may affect behavioral and intellectual development in the offspring. The associations between gestational ketonemia in the mother and a lower IQ in the child warrant continued efforts to avoid ketoacidosis and accelerated starvation in all pregnant women.",GH1,rhesus monkey,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"hypothalamic metabolic modulation, down",Metabolic Regulation,hypothalamus,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",third ventricular (ivt) infusions,Intraperitoneal BHB,NS

Four rhesus monkeys had been prepared for chronic remote iv and ivt infusions as well as blood sampling from the adjacent room. Statistical evaluation used a two-way analysis of variance and individual comparisons with Tukey's Studentized range test. The GH response (area under the curve +/- SE) to IHG was significantly reduced by a concomitant ivt glucose infusion (control, 1.0 +/- 0.1; IHG, 12.1 +/- 3.3; IHG plus ivt glucose, 7.0 +/- 1.2 microgram/L.120 min). The GH response to FFA depression was significantly reduced by ivt Ol-Ac or beta OHB infusion (control, 6.0 +/- 1.0; NA, 51.5 +/- 4.1; Na plus Ol-Ac, 81.2 +/- 1.3; NA plus beta OHB, 38.6 +/- 3.5 microgram/L.300 min). Introcerebroventricular infusions of glucose, Ol-Ac, or beta OHB alone had no effect on plasma GH, glucose, FFA, or beta OHB concentrations. These results provide evidence for a hypothalamic site of metabolic modulation of GH secretion in the rhesus monkey.

Blood concentration of BOHB was significantly higher in diabetic (1,380 +/- 250 mumol/L) and starved (1,229 +/- 245 mumol/L) rats than in controls (104 +/- 8 mumol/L). The hindquarter was perfused with synthetic medium at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/g muscle weight/min. BOHB was added to the medium at a concentration of 0.1, 0.5, 2, or 10 mmol/L, and insulin was added at a concentration of 20, 100, or 500 microU/mL. In the hindquarter perfused with 0.1, 0.5, 2, or 10 mmol/L BOHB, fractional uptake of BOHB in the absence or presence of insulin was significantly lower in diabetic and starved rats than in controls. The addition of 100 or 500 microU/mL insulin significantly increased BOHB uptake in the perfused hindquarter of control rats; however, insulin addition did not significantly increase BOHB uptake in the perfused hindquarter of starved and diabetic rats. These results suggest that BOHB uptake is markedly reduced in the perfused hindquarter of starved and diabetic rats, and that physiological dose of insulin stimulates BOHB uptake in control rats, but not in starved and diabetic rats.",0,15-day-old rats,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

In some experiments cerebrum prisms were incubated in the presence of glucose and either MMA or propionate in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.0. In others, the incubation medium contained beta-hydroxybutyrate (HBA) or acetoacetate (AcAc) instead of glucose. We verified that MMA increased glucose uptake by brain of fasting animals, whereas propionate had no effect. In addition, MMA diminished HBA but not AcAc incorporation into brain prisms, whereas propionate provoked a diminished utilization of both ketone bodies by brain. The in vitro effect of MMA and propionate on brain and liver beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity was also investigated. It was shown that MMA but not propionate significantly inhibited this activity. Rats were also injected subcutaneously three times with a MMA buffered solution, and the in vivo effects of MMA on the above-mentioned parameters assessed. Results from these experiments confirmed the previously found in vitro MMA effects. Methylmalonic acidemic patients accumulate primarily methylmalonate and secondarily propionate and other metabolites in their tissues at levels comparable to those we used in our assays. Most patients who survive early stages of the disease show a variable degree of neuromotor delay. Since glucose and sometimes ketones are the vital substrates for brain metabolism, it is possible that our findings may contribute to a certain extent to an understanding of the biochemical basis of mental retardation in these patients.",0,rat hair follicles,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"pentose phosphate pathway flux, down",Metabolic Regulation,hair follicle,Skin/Integument,matrix cells,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

We have previously shown that viable and intact rat hair follicles can be isolated by shearing, and in this study we now report on their fuel metabolism. In this study we have shown that the hair follicle exhibits aerobic glycolysis, in that of the total glucose utilized by the hair follicle, only 10% is oxidized to CO2. We have also shown that, in the absence of glucose, the hair follicle is capable of utilizing other fuels such as palmitate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. However, neither palmitate or beta-hydroxybutyrate had any effect on the rate of glucose utilization or on [U-14C] glucose oxidation, showing that glucose sparing via the glucose fatty acid cycle does not operate in the hair follicle. Measurements of glucose flux through the pentose phosphate pathway accounted for only 3% of the total glucose utilized by the hair follicle, although this value represented 32% of the total glucose oxidized.

Ketones, intermediates of lipid metabolism, have been proposed to mediate this change. Therefore, we investigated their direct effect on cultured pancreatic acinar cells and examined their possible interactive effects with glucose and dietary fat. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (0.01 to 2 mmol/L) did not affect lipase activity in cells isolated from rats fed a commercial nonpurified (NP) diet and cultured in high glucose (HG, 27.8 mmol/L) or low glucose (LG, 6.9 mmol/L) medium.

Cellular lipase was significantly higher in cells from HF-fed rats at both 24 and 48 h (264% and 145% of LF values, respectively; P less than 0.0001). beta-Hydroxybutyrate significantly increased (P less than 0.04) lipase activity in LF cells at 48 h but did not affect lipase activity in HF cells.

2097037,Effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate on oxidative metabolism and phosphorylation potential in canine heart in vivo.,"beta-Hydroxy-butyrate (HBA) is an effective substrate for mitochondrial respiration (MVO2) in the heart. Myocardial HBA oxidation is associated with high mitochondrial NADH and an inhibition of glycolytic flux. The purpose of this study was to investigate if the infusion of HBA in vivo could modify the coupling mechanisms between myocardial MVO2 and work in the presence and absence of epinephrine. The extraction of several oxidized metabolites, O2, and HBA was measured during the infusion of HBA as well as the high-energy phosphate metabolites using 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. HBA infusion did not affect the MVO2 or function of the heart with or without epinephrine infusion. However, HBA increased the phosphorylation potential by decreasing inorganic phosphate and the calculated free ADP concentration under both conditions. This is consistent with HBA increasing the mitochondrial NADH, which results in an increase in the phosphorylation potential without modifying function. These data demonstrate that substrates, specifically HBA, can modulate the cardiac phosphorylation potential in vivo. The most likely mechanism for this effect is through the mitochondrial NADH concentration.",0,broody turkey hens,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"ovulation rate, down",Hormonal Regulation,plasma,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"ovulation rate, down","Ovulation rate, down",NS,NS,D-BHB

This study was undertaken to investigate the ability of the fetal sheep brain to use potential alternative substrates when they were provided in increased amounts. Brain substrate uptake was measured in chronically catheterised fetal sheep during 2-h infusions of neutralised lactate (n = 12) or beta-hydroxybutyrate (n = 12). Despite large increases in fetal arterial lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate during the respective infusions, no significant uptake of either substrate was demonstrated. However during both types of infusion, the brain arterio-venous difference for glucose decreased 30% (P less than 0.05). Since the brain arterio-venous difference for oxygen was unchanged, and blood flow to the cerebral hemispheres (measured in 11 studies) was also unchanged, the infusions appeared to cause a true decrease in brain glucose uptake. This decrease paralleled the rise in lactate concentration during lactate infusions, and the rise in lactate and butyrate concentrations during the butyrate infusions. Both substrates have metabolic actions that may inhibit brain glucose uptake. We speculate that the deleterious effects of high lactate and ketone states in the perinatal period may in part be due to inhibition of brain glucose uptake.",0,human fat cells; intact mononuclear cells of peripheral blood,human; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"beta-adrenoceptor affinity, down",Hormonal Regulation,human fat cells,NS,adipocyte,Adipose,White adipocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis, down","Lipolysis, down",D-(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate (10 mmol/l),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

The basal lipolysis was not modified and beta-hydroxybutyrate did not affect forskolin- or dibutyryl-cAMP-stimulated glycerol release, whereas it markedly inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis. In membranes of intact adipocytes exposed to D-(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate for 1 h, we found a decrease in beta-adrenoceptor affinity in saturation experiments and a shift to the right of the isoproterenol-mediated radioligand [( 125I]-cyanopindolol) displacement curve. These findings suggest that beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibits catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis by decreasing beta-adrenoceptor affinity. No effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate was found on beta-adrenoceptor binding of intact mononuclear cells of peripheral blood. In conclusion, the beta-adrenoceptor affinity lowering effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate is seemingly specific to human fat cells and might represent a feed-back mechanism that prevents an uncontrolled breakdown of triglycerides and indirectly regulates its own production rate.",INS,rat pancreatic islets,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"metabolism in islet cells, up",Metabolic Regulation,pancreatic islets,Pancreas,islet cells,Pancreatic Endocrine,Islet cells (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",D-(-)-beta-Hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

This coincides with stimulation of both proinsulin biosynthesis and 45Ca net uptake. The ketone bodies also decrease 45Ca outflow from prelabeled islets perifused in the absence of Ca2+ and, in contrast, enhance effluent radioactivity in the presence of Ca2+. In the presence of D-glucose, the secretory response to D-(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate is concentration related in the 2.5-20 mM range, abolished in the absence of Ca2+ or presence of KCN, and enhanced by theophylline and forskolin. It corresponds grossly to a shift to the left of the sigmoidal curve relating insulin output to the ambient concentration of D-glucose. The secretory, biosynthetic, and cationic response to acetoacetate is less marked than that evoked by an equimolar concentration of D-(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate. These features are compatible with the view that the insulinotropic action of ketone bodies would be causally linked to their metabolism in islet cells.",INS,rat pancreatic islets,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"ATP generation, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,pancreatic islets,Pancreas,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"insulin release, up","Insulin secretion, up",D-(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB
2233276,Ketone bodies and islet function: 86Rb handling and metabolic data.,"The metabolism of ketone bodies was investigated in rat pancreatic islets incubated in the absence or presence of D-glucose. The generation of 14CO2 from 3-14C-labeled ketone bodies, the interconversion of D-(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate (AcAc), the reciprocal effects of ketone bodies and D-glucose on their respective catabolism, and the influence of these exogenous nutrients on the output of 14CO2 from islets preincubated with either L-[U-14C]glutamine or [U-14C]palmitate provided an estimation of the nutrient-induced changes in O2 uptake that was in fair agreement with the observed modifications of islet respiration. There was a close correlation between such changes and the corresponding values for insulin output. Because the stimulation of insulin release by ketone bodies also coincided with a decrease in 86Rb outflow from prelabeled islets, these findings suggest that the insulinotropic action of ketone bodies is causally linked to their catabolism through an increase in ATP generation rate and a subsequent decrease in K+ conductance. A complementary participation of changes in mitochondrial redox state to stimulus-secretion coupling is considered, however, in the light of comparisons between the effects of D-(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate and AcAc, respectively, on mitochondrial NADH generation, 45Ca net uptake, and D-[6-14C]glucose oxidation.",0,rats; fasted control rats; fasted E coli-treated rats; fed control rats; fed E coli-treated rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"peripheral utilization, up",Metabolic Regulation,diaphragm,Skeletal muscle,hepatocytes,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Sepsis,Infectious,"blood ketone bodies, down","Blood ketones (BHB), down",[3-14C]beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
2276080,Altered ketone body metabolism during gram-negative sepsis in the rat.,"To investigate why blood ketone bodies are depressed during sepsis, the production and utilization of ketone bodies was studied in fasted control, fasted, Escherichia coli-treated, fed control, and fed E coli-treated rats. Gram-negative sepsis was induced by intravenous (IV) injection of 8 x 10(7) live colonies of E coli per 100 g body weight. Food was removed from the fasted rats after E coli injection. Fed rats were infused intragastrically with a nutritionally adequate diet for 5 days before inducing sepsis. Twenty-four hours after E coli injection, blood ketone bodies were reduced in fasted septic rats and fed septic rats compared with their respective control rats. Ketogenesis and oxidation of labeled palmitate was not altered in hepatocytes from fasted E coli-treated rats. Yet, ketogenesis declined significantly in hepatocytes from fed E coli-treated rats. Oxidation of labeled palmitate was also significantly reduced in hepatocytes from fed E coli-treated rats. Utilization of ketone bodies as measured by the incorporation of [3-14C]beta-hydroxybutyrate into CO2, increased over threefold in the diaphragm, 12% in the heart, and 19% in the kidneys from the fasted E coli-treated rats. In the fed state, incorporation of [3-14C]beta-hydroxybutyrate into CO2 was elevated fivefold in the heart, fourfold in the diaphragm, and over threefold in the kidneys from the septic rats. These results suggest that in the fasted state, plasma ketone bodies remain low during gram-negative sepsis because peripheral tissues use more ketone bodies and because liver ketogenesis is not increased to compensate for the increased utilization. In the fed state, the reduction in blood ketone bodies appears to be attributed to both impaired ketogenic capacity and increased peripheral utilization.",0,"normal rats; streptozotocin-diabetic rats (100 mg/kg, 2-3 days); TG-loaded myocytes",animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells,"lipolysis, up",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,myocytes,Muscle – Skeletal,Skeletal myocytes / myotubes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"basal lipolysis, up; isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis, no-change","Lipolysis, up; Lipolysis, no-change",beta-hydroxybutyrate (4 and 8 mM) and acetoacetate (1 and 2 mM),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

In addition, the effect of these exogenous substrates on rates of lipolysis was investigated in triacylglycerol (TG) loaded myocytes prepared from normal hearts by inclusion of oleate in the isolation solutions. Diabetic and TG-loaded myocytes had higher lipolytic rates than normal myocytes. In control myocytes, oleate (1.2 mM) did not affect basal lipolysis, but it reduced isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis by 30%. In diabetic and TG-loaded myocytes, the addition of 1.2 mM oleate inhibited basal rates of lipolysis by 41 and 40%, respectively, and isoproterenol-stimulated rates of lipolysis by 43 and 53%, respectively. However, lipolytic rates measured in the presence of 1.2 mM oleate with diabetic and TG-loaded myocytes were still higher than lipolysis in normal myocytes incubated in the absence of oleate. Ketone bodies increased both basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in normal myocytes. In diabetic myocytes, ketone bodies produced a modest stimulation of basal lipolysis but had no effect on isoproterenol-stimulated rates of lipolysis. These data indicate that mobilization of endogenous TG may play an important role in supplying energy to the heart in the diabetic state. Moreover, accumulation of endogenous TG in diabetic myocardium can only partly be explained by inhibition of lipolysis by exogenous substrates.",0,mouse embryos (2-3 somite stage); neurulating mouse embryos (5-6 somite stage),animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse,"pyrimidine biosynthesis, down",Metabolic Regulation,embryo,Systemic/Whole organism,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Neural tube defects,Genetic / Congenital,"neural tube defects incidence, up","Neural tube defects incidence, up","D,L,-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB)",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic
2328737,"Biochemical basis for D,L,-beta-hydroxybutyrate-induced teratogenesis.","Previous investigations have demonstrated that a potential mechanism for D,L,-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB)-induced teratogenesis in neurulating mouse embryos (5-6 somite stage) after 24 hours of exposure in vitro is mediated by an inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (Hunter, et al. '87). Employing conceptuses of an earlier stage (2-3 somite stage), the biochemistry of BOHB-induced abnormalities was examined further by exposing embryos to 32 mM BOHB for 24 hour and comparing results with controls with respect to the rate of metabolism via the PPP, de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis (PB), and BOHB utilization. Moreover, the capability of these BOHB-exposed embryos to recover from such an insult was also assessed by transferring them to fresh control medium and allowing them to grow for an additional 36 hours. Both controls and BOHB-exposed embryos showed a progressive increase in rate of BOHB utilization between days 9 and 11.5 of gestation in vitro. Exposure to ketone body produced a 100% rate of neural tube defects and a 25.2% decrease in total embryonic protein content. In contrast to results obtained at the 5-6 somite stage, no inhibition of the PPP in whole conceptuses, embryos, or visceral yolk sacs was observed in the group exposed to BOHB at the 2-3 somite stage. Furthermore, a 7.5 mM D-ribose supplement, an intermediate in the PPP, was unable to rescue the younger embryos from BOHB-induced abnormalities and growth retardation. On the other hand, BOHB produced a 34.3% decrease in pyrimidine biosynthesis in the 2-3 somite embryos, but not in the visceral yolk sac. In addition, embryos recovered biochemically after being transferred to control medium, demonstrating a 25.5% overshoot in pyrimidine biosynthesis. Therefore, the mechanism of BOHB-induced teratogenesis appears to differ depending on the stage of embryonic development at the time of initial exposure.",0,WI-38 fibroblasts; old rats,human; animal; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells; Animal – Rat,"inhibition of cell degeneration, down",Cell Death & Survival,NS,NS,WI-38 fibroblasts,Stromal / Mesenchymal,Fibroblasts,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cell degeneration, down","Cell viability, down",D(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate sodium salt,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB
2332105,Involvement of mitochondria in cell degeneration.,"Human WI-38 fibroblasts were microinjected with isolated mitochondria, and survival of the injected cells was followed. More than 95% of the cells were alive and able to divide when they were injected with fresh mitochondrial preparations having a high respiratory control ratio (RCR). The presence of lysosomes was found to be toxic to the cells, and hence mitochondria had to be isolated without being contaminated by lysosomes. The microinjection of isolated mitochondria from old rats induced a 20% degeneration of the injected cells. The proportion of dead cells was also found to be dependent on the metabolic control of the injected mitochondria. Moreover, an easily metabolized energy substrate such as D(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate sodium salt was able to inhibit, in a dose-dependent manner, cell degeneration induced by microinjection of uncoupled mitochondria. These results suggest that modifications of mitochondria leading to their uncoupling are harmful to the cells, and this can explain some of the degenerative processes observed in natural or externally induced cell death.",0,extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscles from fed chicks; EDC muscles from fasted chicks,animal; in vitro,Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"glutamine oxidation, up",Metabolic Regulation,skeletal muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

The addition of 4 mM acetoacetate or DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate to the incubation medium decreased the rate of protein synthesis without influencing the rate of protein degradation in extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscles from fed chicks and decreased the rates of protein synthesis and degradation in muscles from fasted chicks. 2. Ketone bodies markedly decreased intracellular concentrations of glutamine in EDC muscles from fed chicks by increasing glutamine oxidation. 3. The addition of 0.5 mM glutamine to incubation media containing 1.0 mM glutamine reversed the ketone body-induced decrease in intracellular glutamine concentration to the control value and blocked the inhibiting effect of ketone bodies on protein synthesis in skeletal muscles from fed chicks. 4. The addition of 5 mM pyruvate blocked the ability of ketone bodies to increase glutamine oxidation and prevented the associated decrease in intracellular glutamine concentration and the rate of protein synthesis in EDC muscles from fed chicks. 5.

2442356,Levels of [3H]glucosamine incorporation into hyaluronic acid by fibroblasts is modulated by culture conditions.,"Tissue culture conditions can modulate apparent levels of incorporation of the radiolabeled precursor [3H]glucosamine into hyaluronic acid in cells. A careful study was made on the effects of culture conditions on human skin fibroblasts. A newly described technique to measure hyaluronic acid was utilized based on incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into cetylpyridinium chloride-precipitable hyaluronidase-digestible material. The precipitate was collected on glass fiber filters using a manifold suction apparatus. A six-fold greater level of incorporation occurred in rapidly growing preconfluent than in confluent fibroblasts. Ascorbic acid stimulated incorporation with a maximum at 25 micrograms/ml. The same ascorbic acid optimum was observed for collagen prolylhydroxylation. When beta-hydroxybutyrate was used as an energy source instead of D-glucose, a 3.5-fold increase in levels was observed. All tissue-culture media examined supported comparable levels of incorporation, except for Roswell Park Memorial Institute Media-1640, in which cells had only half the level. Fetal calf serum supported high levels of incorporation in a dose-dependent manner, while newborn calf and calf sera supported much lower levels of incorporation. Under serum-free conditions, lactalbumin hydrolysate was best able to support incorporation of hyaluronic acid. In the search for mechanisms that modulate hyaluronic acid, it is critical to consider the tissue culture conditions under which incorporation of radiolabeled precursors are being examined.",ATP1A1,guinea-pig taenia from caecum,animal; in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal,"oxidative phosphorylation, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,taenia from the guinea-pig caecum,Large intestine/Colon,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-HB (11.8 mM),In vitro media supplementation,NS
2513232,Glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation during activation of the sodium pump in the taenia from guinea-pig caecum.,"1. In the taenia from the guinea-pig caecum, the relative contribution of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to activation of the Na pump was estimated by measuring changes in the rate of O2 consumption (QO2) and lactate production (Q1act). The Na pump was activated by K readmission following prior treatment with K-free solution. The QO2 and Q1act were both increased significantly by K readmission 60 min after exposure to K-free solution. These changes and the reaccumulation of tissue K were abolished by ouabain (10 microM). Spontaneous mechanical activity ceased in K-free solution and the K-induced increase in QO2 and Q1act was produced before the mechanical activity was restarted. 2. Similar changes were obtained when ouabain (10 microM) was removed after 60 min treatment. It was estimated from the changes in QO2 and Q1act that the oxidative and glycolytic metabolism each supplied about 50% of the total ATP demand for pump activation. 3. In Ca-free solution, the increase in QO2 caused by K readmission was transient and QO2 returned to the previous value in K-free solution in 10-20 min. However, the increase in QO2 was maintained in the absence of glucose. When glucose was replaced with beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB, 11.8 mM), which is metabolized only through oxidative phosphorylation, K readmission also produced a sustained increase in QO2. 4. In glycogen-depleted preparations, K readmission produced little or no increase in QO2 in the absence of substrate or in the presence of glucose. On the other hand, in the presence of beta-HB (11.8 mM), a typical increase in QO2 (about 0.1 mumol min-1 g-1) was observed in response to K readmission. Lactate production was negligible in the absence of substrate or in the presence of beta-HB, but it was significantly increased after K readmission in the presence of glucose. The increase in tissue K content following K readmission was the same in the presence of glucose or beta-HB. 5. In the glycogen-depleted preparations the increase in QO2 caused by beta-HB was dependent on the presence of both Na and K in the medium, and sensitive to ouabain. Furthermore, this response was reversibly suppressed by glucose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0,human polymorphonuclear leukocytes; A23187-stimulated; opsonized zymosan-stimulated,human; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells; NS,"PAF production, up",Inflammation & Immune Response,blood,Blood,polymorphonuclear leukocytes,Unspecified / Mixed,Mixed cell population,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Such an augmentation was observed even at 500 microM but not at 50 microM. The augmented production of PAF by acetoacetate was also observed in the presence of autologous serum and was most prominent in the case of opsonized zymosan-stimulation rather than A23187-stimulation.

Ten mM beta-hydroxybutyrate did not inhibit lipolysis caused by epinephrine although any lipolysis stimulated by epinephrine, dibutyryl cyclic AMP and theophylline was inhibited by insulin.

To decrease blood glucose and to raise fetal blood ketone body concentrations, 19-day pregnant rats were submitted to 48 or 96 h of starvation. To differentiate between the effects of decreased blood glucose and increased ketone body concentrations, fed pregnant rats were infused for 2 h with DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate. After 96 h of maternal starvation, fetal 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) uptake decreased from 13.6 +/- 0.5 to 8.6 +/- 1.15 micrograms.min-1.g-1. This was mainly due to a decrease in 2DG uptake by fetal hindlimb muscles and heart. By contrast, 2DG uptake in fetal liver and brain was not affected by maternal starvation. Acute hyperketonemia in fed pregnant rats induced a 23% decrease in 2DG uptake by the whole fetus mainly as the result of a lowered 2DG uptake in fetal hindlimb muscles. These data suggest that fetal 2DG uptake does not simply depend on lowered blood glucose level during maternal starvation but that other hormonal, cardiovascular, or metabolic adaptations are implicated.

After a loading dose (600 mg/kg), NaBOHB was infused for 70 min (300 mg/kg.hr) into the maternal femoral vein of eight pregnant baboons, and placental transfer and fetal and maternal metabolic changes were observed during an acute experimental protocol. Maternal arterial levels rose from 0.70 +/- 0.21 to 5.42 +/- 0.93 mM (p less than 0.001), and fetal arterial levels from 0.34 +/- 0.09 to 2.76 +/- 0.64 mM (p less than 0.01). A maternal-fetal gradient of approximately 2:1 was observed in both baseline and steady-state infusion conditions and is similar to the human maternal-fetal ketone gradient. This is in contrast to the sheep where significantly higher gradients have been described. The elevated lactate, from 1.90 +/- 0.34 to 2.88 +/- 0.54 mM (p less than 0.05) and somewhat decreased pO2 values in the fetus from 54.8 +/- 8.9 to 45.0 +/- 3.8 mm Hg (p greater than 0.05 less than 0.1), without change in oxygen consumption (2.00 +/- 0.28 versus 1.73 +/- 0.15 mM/min) are features common to conditions of increased levels of fetal energy substrate.

Similar changes were observed when iodoacetate (10 microM) was added to the incubation medium. Moreover, the depletion of an energy source led to more drastic changes.

Adult male albino mice (Mus musculus) weighing 25-30 g were subjected to three pretreatment hypoxic exposures (4.5% O2, balance N2) of increasing duration (90, 120, and 150 seconds) with 300 seconds of normoxia between each pretreatment exposure and before testing of hypoxic survival time. Acute pretreatment exposures to hypoxia significantly increased mean +/- SEM hypoxic survival time from 108 +/- 4 to 403 +/- 42 seconds. Mean +/- SEM blood glucose concentrations increased significantly from 201 +/- 19 to 397 +/- 10 mg/dl immediately after hypoxic pretreatment. A significant increase in mean +/- SEM blood ketone concentrations, from 0.15 +/- 0.01 to 0.40 +/- 0.08 mM, was detected in the blood 1,800 seconds but not 300 seconds after hypoxic pretreatment. However, pretreatment with exogenous glucose or ketones alone, to mimic the blood levels seen after hypoxic pretreatment, failed to increase hypoxic survival time. In contrast, mice pretreated with hypoxic exposures plus the exogenous substrate beta-hydroxybutyrate had an increased mean +/- SEM hypoxic survival time of 749 +/- 48 seconds and a decreased body temperature. Stepwise Cox regression analyses with body temperature as a fixed covariate suggest that this decrease in body temperature has a partial role in, but can not fully account for, the increased hypoxic survival time. These data suggest that sequential exposures to hypoxia induce metabolic changes that protect against the lethal effects of hypoxia, perhaps by altering substrate mobilization and utilization and/or by inducing a hypometabolic hypothermia.",0,spontaneously active rat portal vein,animal,Animal – Rat,"membrane hyperpolarization, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,portal vein,Vasculature,vascular smooth muscle,Muscle – Smooth / Perivascular,Visceral smooth muscle,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Tissue hypoxia,General Signs & Symptoms,"membrane potential hyperpolarization, up","Membrane potential, up",used as substrate,NS,NS
2827938,Electrical and mechanical responses to inhibition of cell respiration in vascular smooth muscle of the rat portal vein.,"Metabolic regulation of contractility in vascular smooth muscle was studied in the spontaneously active rat portal vein using respiratory depression by cyanide (0.2-2.0 mM) as a model for tissue hypoxia. Intracellular recordings of electrical activity were done with concomitant registration of force development. Average membrane potential in the absence of cyanide was -61 +/- 1 mV (n = 27). Addition of cyanide to normal Krebs solution resulted in a reduction of force amplitude and the number of action potentials per burst, with a relatively more pronounced effect on the mechanical activity. At moderate levels of inhibition of force amplitude the frequency of spontaneous bursts of action potentials transiently increased concomitant with a slight depolarization, but after prolonged (15-20 min) exposure to cyanide the membrane repolarized to the level prior to cyanide addition and the burst frequency decreased to be equal to or lower than that in the absence of cyanide. Higher concentrations of cyanide totally inhibited spontaneous mechanical and electrical activity. In contrast to the results with glucose, it was found that when beta-hydroxybutyrate was used as substrate the addition of 2 mM cyanide led to a marked hyperpolarization (13 +/- 1 mV) after total inhibition of spontaneous activity. The hyperpolarization was not prevented by administration of 4-aminopyridine (2.5 mM) or tetraethylammonium (4-6 mM) prior to the addition of cyanide. To investigate the effects of increased metabolic demand on the relation between force and membrane potential in cyanide-treated muscle, high-K+ (40 mM) contractures were studied. Contractures were associated with depolarization of 34 +/- 3 mV (n = 5). 1 mM cyanide reduced the amplitude of the contractures to about 9% of control with a moderate reduction in the amount of depolarization (28 +/- 1 mV, n = 5). It is concluded that the decrease of mechanical activity during respiratory inhibition may partly reflect a reduction in the number of spikes per burst but that other mechanisms, independent of membrane activity, also contribute to the inhibition. The increase of glycolysis during respiratory inhibition seems to prevent more pronounced changes in membrane potential.",0,dogs starved for 12 h,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"ketone-specific inhibition of alanine production rate, down",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion,Multi-source,NS
2904261,The effect of ketone bodies on leucine and alanine metabolism in dogs.,1. The effect of an infusion of sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate on leucine and alanine metabolism was investigated in dogs starved for 12 h. To determine whether the metabolic changes produced by this infusion were due to the resultant alkalaemia the effect of an equimolar infusion of sodium bicarbonate was also studied. 2. The sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion reduced alanine concentration as a result of a decrease in alanine production rate and an increase in alanine metabolic clearance rate. The sodium bicarbonate infusion induced a small decrease in alanine concentration which was due to an increased metabolic clearance rate. Alanine production rate showed no change. This demonstrates that the fall in alanine concentration after a sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion is due both to a ketone-specific inhibitory effect on alanine production rate and an increased metabolic clearance rate caused by the alkalaemia. 3. Leucine concentration was increased after the ketone infusion due to a small increase in production rate and there was a small increase in the rate of leucine incorporation into protein. Alkalaemia had no effect on leucine concentration or metabolism.,BCAT1; 0,extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscles from 24 h-fasted chicks,animal; in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal,"inhibition of glycolysis, down",Metabolic Regulation,extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscles,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (4 mM),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

(2) Ketone bodies (1 and 4 mM) increase the intracellular concentration and release of glutamate and glutamine, suggesting that inhibition of BCAA transamination does not limit intracellular availability of glutamate for alanine synthesis. (3) Ketone bodies (1 and 4 mM) do not affect glucose uptake by muscles, but decrease the rate of glycolysis as well as the intracellular concentration and release of pyruvate in muscles. (4) Addition of 12 mM-glucose increases the formation of alanine in muscles incubated in the absence of ketone bodies, but has no effect in muscles incubated in the presence of 4 mM ketone bodies. (5) Addition of 5 mM-pyruvate to the media prevents the inhibiting effect of ketone bodies on BCAA transamination and alanine synthesis. These results suggest that ketone bodies decrease alanine synthesis by limiting the intracellular availability of pyruvate, owing to inhibition of glycolysis, and inhibit BCAA transamination by decreasing the intracellular concentration of amino-group acceptors such as pyruvate in EDC muscles from fasted chicks.",0,mouse embryos,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse,"synergism, up",Other / Unspecified,embryo,Systemic/Whole organism,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetic embryopathy,Genetic / Congenital,"growth retardation, up; malformations, up","Body weight, up; Malformations, up",D-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB
3084140,Evidence for multifactorial origin of diabetes-induced embryopathies.,"Serum factors characteristically altered in the diabetic state, e.g., glucose, ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate), and somatomedin inhibitors, induce dysmorphogenesis with or without growth retardation in rodent embryos in whole-embryo culture. Furthermore, serum from diabetic animals, which contains combinations of altered factors, is teratogenic, thereby implying that the diabetic embryopathy is of a multifactorial origin. However, a detailed investigation with various combinations of factors at known concentrations to test this hypothesis has not been conducted. Therefore, we employed combinations of hyperglycemia (300 and 600 mg/dl; 16.6 and 33.3 mM), hyperketonemia (8 and 16 mM D-beta-hydroxybutyrate), and an 800- to 1000-Mr somatomedin-inhibitor serum fraction (at an amount equal to that found in 0.05 and 0.1 ml of serum from a diabetic rat per deciliter culture medium), which represented doses with low teratogenic potential, to determine if interactions of the factors could occur that would increase the risk of malformations in mouse embryos exposed in whole-embryo culture during gastrulation and neurulation. The results demonstrate that glucose and D-beta-hydroxybutyrate can act synergistically to produce growth retardation and additively to induce malformations. The addition of the somatomedin inhibitor exacerbates the induction of malformations produced by the ketone body and glucose. Thus, the origin of the diabetic embryopathy may be multifactorial, involving several altered maternal factors.",0,25 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes; 17 controls,human; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"neutrophil killing, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,NS,NS,neutrophil,Hematopoietic / Immune,Neutrophils,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Type 1 diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"Candida killing, down","Antimicrobial activity, down",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
3107785,Neutrophil phagocytosis and killing in insulin-dependent diabetes.,"Neutrophil phagocytosis and killing of Candida albicans were examined using a radiometric assay in 25 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and 17 controls under various in vitro metabolic conditions. Glucose was present at 5, 10 and 50 mM, beta-hydroxybutyrate at 1, 5 and 20 mM and glucose with beta-hydroxybutyrate in combinations of 10 with 5 and 50 with 20 mM, respectively. Phagocytosis occurred at similar levels in diabetics and controls at all the glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations used. The ability to neutrophils from diabetics to kill candida was inhibited by increased concentrations of glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate, both independently and in combination. Candida killing (mean +/- s.e.) was 20 +/- 2.4, 19 +/- 2.3 and 13 +/- 2.7% at glucose concentrations of 5, 10 and 50 mM; and 20 +/- 3.4, 20 +/- 3 and 13 +/- 3% at beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations of 1, 5 and 20 mM, respectively, and in glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate combinations of 10 with 5 and 50 with 20 mM was 20 +/- 2.8 and 10 +/- 2.8%, respectively. Inhibition was not observed with control neutrophils. These data indicate that although phagocytosis occurs at similar levels in diabetics and controls, killing of candida by the diabetic neutrophil is impaired under conditions of hyperglycaemia and ketosis.

3111272,Competition between fatty acids and carbohydrate or ketone bodies as metabolic fuels for the isolated perfused heart.,"The ability of carbohydrate fuels (lactate, pyruvate, glucose) and the ketone bodies (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate) to compete with fatty acids as fuels of respiration in the isolated Langendorf-perfused heart was studied. Oleate and octanoate were used as fatty acid fuels since oleate requires carnitine for entry into mitochondria, whereas octanoate does not. The two ketone bodies inhibited the oxidation of both oleate and octanoate implying an intramitochondrial site of action. Pyruvate, lactate, and lactate plus glucose inhibited oleate oxidation but not octanoate oxidation, indicating a mechanism of inhibition that involves the carnitine system. Pyruvate was a more potent inhibitor than lactate at equal concentrations, but the effect of lactate could be greatly increased by dichloroacetate, an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase.

Thus, to delineate a potential mechanism, the interaction of the ketone body with embryonic glucose metabolism was investigated. Mouse embryos were exposed in whole embryo culture to DL-BOHB or each isomer separately during the period of neurulation. The results demonstrate that DL-BOHB inhibits glucose oxidation by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) with no concomitant effect on Krebs cycle or glycolysis. Furthermore, decreased rates of embryonic uridine monophosphate and DNA synthesis were produced by DL-BOHB, whereas orotate synthesis was unaffected, thereby suggesting that the availability of ribose moieties synthesized by the PPP was compromised. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that addition of ribose to DL-BOHB-containing medium reduced the incidence of ketone body-induced neural tube defects and maintained the rates of DNA synthesis at control levels. Furthermore, these biochemical alterations are due to the synergistic effects of the D and L isomers and may be related to changes in redox states.",TSHB; 0,streptozotocin-diabetic rats; BHB-treated normal rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"depression of pituitary and plasma TSH, down",Multiple mechanisms,pituitary,Pituitary,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

To test the role of beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) and acidosis in generating such changes, we studied the pituitary-thyroid axis of streptozotocin-diabetic rats, BHB or ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)-treated normal rats. Serum TSH, pituitary content and pituitary concentration of TSH, serum T4, T3 and free T4 (FT4), were all measured by RIA. In short term (2 days) diabetic rats the pituitary content of TSH was normal whereas the concentration (per mg of protein) was elevated (p less than 0.05 versus control group). Serum TSH (p less than 0.05), serum T4 (p less than 0.05), serum T3 (p less than 0.01) and serum FT4 (p less than 0.05) were all significantly decreased. In long term (30 days) untreated diabetic rats serum changes were similar to the short term diabetic group, though the pituitary content of TSH was significantly decreased (p less than 0.05). Animals treated with NH4Cl had no variations from controls. However, rats treated with BHB displayed a significant decrease in pituitary content of TSH (p less than 0.05), pituitary concentration of TSH (p less than 0.05) and in plasma TSH (p less than 0.01), and normal thyroid hormones in serum. No significant changes were seen in the TSH response to TRH in 2 or 30 days untreated diabetic and in BHB - treated animals. The data suggest that BHB, although not NH4Cl acidosis, may be capable of inducing a moderate depression of pituitary and plasma TSH of a lesser magnitude of that accompanying the full, long term diabetic state in the rat.",0,streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats; mammalian whole embryo culture,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"DNA synthesis, NS","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",embryo,Systemic/Whole organism,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Congenital malformations,Genetic / Congenital,"incidence of congenital malformations, up","Congenital malformations, up",hyperketonemia (beta-hydroxybutyrate),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
3224520,Effects of maternal diabetes on embryogenesis.,"Through the use of the in vitro technique of mammalian whole embryo culture, the factors and mechanisms responsible for the increased incidence of congenital malformations among infants of diabetic mothers have been investigated. During early stages of embryogenesis, serum from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, hyperketonemia (beta-hydroxybutyrate), and low molecular weight somatomedin inhibitors are teratogenic or growth inhibitory, or both. Furthermore, combinations of these factors interact to increase the risk of a malformation occurring. In contrast, other factors, such as hyperinsulinemia and excess leucine, palmitic acid, and acetoacetate, have little or no teratogenic potential. Mechanisms of action of the factors are varied and may include alterations of arachidonic acid metabolism (hyperglycemia), glycolysis (hypoglycemia), DNA synthesis (beta-hydroxybutyrate), and embryonic nutrition (somatomedin inhibitors). The results demonstrate that the origin of the diabetic embryopathy is multifactorial, that many of the congenital defects are induced early in gestation before the diabetic woman may realize she is pregnant, and that insulin therapy reduces the risk.",0,multicatheterized ewes,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,ruminant liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
3238593,Effects of estradiol-17 beta on the net hepatic extraction of triglyceride in vivo in fed and fasted sheep.,"The effects of estrogen and fasting on hepatic metabolism were studied by an arteriovenous difference technique in six multicatheterized ewes. In each experiment samples were collected during fed and 3- and 5-day fasted states before, and 10 to 17 days after the animals had been implanted with 550 mg of estradiol-17 beta. The implants elevated plasma estradiol five- to seven-fold. Plasma concentrations of insulin and triglyceride (TG) were increased (P less than 0.01) by 131% and 62% respectively by estradiol in fed sheep. Concurrent circulating concentrations of glucose, glycerol, free fatty acids, and beta-hydroxybutyrate were unaffected. During fasting estradiol elevated circulating concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate slightly, while levels of other metabolites and insulin were not different from fasted controls. In fed animals estradiol had no effect on the net hepatic uptake (NHU) of TG or glycerol but during fasting estradiol reduced the NHU of TG and glycerol by 47% and 31% (P less than 0.01) respectively. In addition, estradiol reduced the net hepatic production of beta-hydroxybutyrate in fed, but not in fasted animals. Net hepatic exchanges of glucose, or FFA were not affected by estradiol in either the fed or fasted state. Fasting increased the NHU of TG (P less than 0.05) and glycerol (P less than 0.01). The results of this study suggest that estradiol, at physiological concentrations, has lipotropic and anti-ketogenic effects on the ruminant liver. However, the anti-ketogenic effect is not apparent in fasted animals. Secondly, it appears that the hepatic lipidosis which often occurs in ruminants during negative energy balance is due largely to an increase in the NHU of circulating TG.",0,early somite stage mouse embryos; whole embryo culture,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"catch-up growth, up","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",neural tube,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Neural tube defects,Genetic / Congenital,"neural tube defects, down","Neural tube defects, down","32 mM D,L,-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D,L,-beta OHB)",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

Early somite stage mouse embryos were exposed to 32 mM D,L,-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D,L,-beta OHB) for 24 hr (Period I), and were then transferred and maintained in control medium for an additional 36 hr maximum (Period II). Growth of this recovery group (Group B) was monitored at various time points of Period II and the results were compared with an unexposed control group (Group A) and another continuously-exposed reference group (Group C). At the end of Period I, 100% of D,L,-beta OHB-exposed embryos exhibited neural tube closure defects and were growth retarded. At 36 hr of Period II, cranial and caudal neural tube defects of Group B embryos were reduced to 3-7% and 0%, respectively. These embryos also demonstrated an excess in growth velocity during recovery so that at the end of Period II, total protein content was comparable to control values. In contrast, Group C embryos remained growth retarded and showed a significant increase in cranial and caudal neural tube defects (20 and 75%, respectively). Thus, neurulating mouse embryos were capable of catch-up growth following an embryotoxic exposure to D,L,-beta OHB. The progression of development of total protein values and morphological features such as elimination of neural tube defects was intimately related to the amount of time allowed for recovery. Moreover, an elevation of growth rate over normality, which is characteristic of catch-up growth, was observed.",0,rats; Levine-Klein model of unilateral carotid occlusion and hypoxia,animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Other Mammal,"starvation-induced ketosis, no-change",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury,Injury & Trauma,"brain infarction, no-change","Infarct size, no-change",NS,NS,NS

In the second part of the study the administration of the substrates beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and glucose has been evaluated regarding their influence upon the effect of fasting. The study used the Levine-Klein model of unilateral carotid occlusion and hypoxia because it mimics clinical situations of ischemia with hypoxia. The data show that fasting did protect rats from developing brain infarction following hypoxia-ischemia. Hypoglycemia seems to be involved in the mitigation of ischemic blood-brain barrier disruption.

To determine whether an acid load produced by amino acid metabolism can similarly modify ketosis, five overweight volunteers ingested methionine (H2SO4), NH4Cl, and NaCl (control), in varying order, each day for seven days during weeks 5 to 8 of hypocaloric ketogenic dieting. During days 5 to 7 of each phase, blood pH, bicarbonate, and pCO2 were stable but lower in the NH4Cl phase (7.32 +/- 0.02, 18.1 +/- 1.2 mmol/L, 35.8 +/- 1.4 mmHg) and the methionine phase (7.33 +/- 0.01, 17.1 +/- 0.9 mmol/L, 34.0 +/- 2.0 mmHg) than in the NaCl phase (7.38 +/- 0.01, 22.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/L, 37.6 +/- 1.6 mmHg), P less than .05. Over this period, blood acetoacetate concentration was lower during the methionine and NH4Cl phases than during NaCl, P less than .05. In addition blood beta-hydroxybutyrate and total ketone-body concentrations were lower in the methionine than NaCl phases, P less than .05. Urinary acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate excretion fell with both acid loads, P less than .05. Compared with control values, urinary total ketone excretion was suppressed by 67 +/- 10% in the NH4Cl and 89 +/- 3% in the methionine periods. When NaCl was ingested after either of the acid loads, urinary ketone excretion increased by 300% to 700%. Thus, methionine ingestion, which results in an acid challenge equivalent to that of a large protein load, has an impact on net ketoacid production similar to that of NH4Cl.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",INS; GCG,perfused rat pancreas,animal,Animal – Rat,"direct inhibition, down",Other / Unspecified,pancreas,Pancreas,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",BOHB infusion,Intravenous BHB,NS

The BOHB or AcAc was administered at concentrations of 10, 1, or 0.1 mM for 30 min at 4.0 ml/min. High-concentration infusions of BOHB and AcAc (10 mM) produced significant increases in insulin release in the presence of 4.4 mM glucose, but low-concentration infusions of BOHB and AcAc (1 and 0.1 mM) caused no significant changes in insulin secretion from perfused rat pancreas. BOHB (10, 1, and 0.1 mM) and AcAc (10 and 1 mM) infusion significantly inhibited glucagon secretion from perfused rat pancreas. These results suggest that physiological concentrations of ketone bodies have no direct effect on insulin release but have a direct inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion from perfused rat pancreas.",INS; HK1; 0; GAPDH; PDHA1,suckling-weanling mice; insulin-induced hypoglycemia model,animal,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Other Mammal,"cerebral glycolysis, down",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Insulin-induced hypoglycemia,Metabolic & Endocrine,"hypoglycemia, reversed","Blood glucose, reversed",DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (20 or 30 mmol/kg ip),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

In the brains of these animals, glucose levels were tripled due to a reduced rate of glucose utilization (determined by deoxyglucose phosphorylation). Other metabolite changes were compatible with inhibition of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-P-dehydrogenase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities. In contrast to the decrease in cerebral glycolysis, metabolite changes were compatible with an increase in the Krebs citric acid metabolic flux. The brain energy charge was also elevated. While it is generally believed that ketone bodies cannot sustain normal brain metabolism and function in the absence of glucose, DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (20 or 30 mmol/kg ip) reversed insulin (100 U/kg sc)-induced hypoglycemia despite the persistence of a critically reduced plasma glucose concentration and near-zero brain glucose levels. Metabolic correlates of possible significance in the behavioral recovery from coma were reductions of the elevated levels of brain aspartate to below normal and ammonia levels to normal.

Since blood pH during beta-OHB infusion was higher than the pH during saline infusion, we performed separate experiments to study the effect of increased blood pH on leucine kinetics by infusing sodium bicarbonate intravenously. Blood pH during sodium bicarbonate infusion was similar to that observed during the beta-OHB infusion, but bicarbonate infusion had no effect on leucine flux or leucine oxidation.

Following a 24-hour culture period D-BOHB induced malformations and growth retardation in a concentration-dependent manner. At a 48 mM concentration essentially all embryos exhibited neural tube defects, and decreased rates of glucose metabolism by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and Krebs cycle were observed when compared to controls. The relationship between an inhibition of the PPP and induction of malformations by DL-BOHB has been reported, and thereby suggests a similar mechanism may be operating for the D-isomer. In contrast, the effect of the D-isomer on the Krebs cycle may result from a replacement of glucose intermediates by those generated from metabolism of D-BOHB. Concentrations as high as 20 mM D-BOHB have been reported in the serum of uncontrolled diabetic patients, and since ketones rapidly equilibrate across extraembryonic membranes, embryos in vivo may be exposed to concentrations equivalent to those which induced malformations in vitro. However, the incidence of malformations induced by D-BOHB was less than that reported for the DL-racemic mixture at equivalent concentrations, thereby suggesting that the L-isomer is also teratogenic.

Adenosine was almost totally metabolized by the liver cells during the first 4 h of the induction period. The inhibitory action of adenosine was also observed using dibutyryl-cAMP or 8-bromo-cAMP as inducer; it could not be prevented by the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine nor could it be mimicked by the selective adenosine receptor agonist N6-(phenylisopropyl)adenosine. 2) Acetoacetate suppressed the induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in a concentration-dependent manner between 5 and 20mM during the first 4 h after glucagon addition. beta-Hydroxybutyrate showed no effect. Neither starting with acetoacetate nor with beta-hydroxybutyrate did the cell cultures establish the thermodynamic equilibrium between the two compounds. 3) Ammonia did not affect induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase at concentrations up to 2mM. Ammonia was converted to urea within the first 4 h; yet it remained at clearly hyperphysiological concentrations in the medium during that period. It is concluded that the glucagon-dependent induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was modulated by the local hormone adenosine via a mechanism not involving adenylate cyclase and by acetoacetate via an unknown mechanism.

The tracers for determining rates of substrate use were [3H]fluorodeoxyglucose and [3-14C]-D-beta-hydroxybutyrate. Two or five minutes after isotope administration the animals were sacrificed in a 6-kW, 2450-MHz focused microwave device. Ten minutes prior to isotope administration the animals were injected intraperitoneally with normal saline or DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (10 mmol/kg).

Rates of glucose utilization were significantly heterogeneous between regions in both groups: thalamus greater than cerebral cortex greater than or equal to striatum greater than brain stem greater than cerebellum. These rates were 20-35% lower in hyperketonemic rats. Rates of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate use varied significantly between regions only in the saline group, with the brain stem rate being significantly lower than that in cortex or cerebellum. Regional rates of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate use did not correlate significantly with regional rates of glucose use in either the saline or the hyperketonemic groups. Regional rates of glucose use were strongly and positively correlated between conditions, as were regional rates of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate use. Thus, in 20-day-old rats, the regional heterogeneity of brain glucose use is similar to that in adult rats. D-beta-Hydroxybutyrate use is much less regionally heterogeneous.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,nine healthy volunteers,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"hepatic and peripheral glucose metabolism, no-change",Multiple mechanisms,hepatic,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"glucose uptake, no-change; basal glucose production, no-change; suppression of hepatic glucose production, no-change","Glucose uptake, no-change; Blood glucose, no-change","sodium D,L-beta-hydroxybutyrate (15 mumol X kg-1 X min-1)",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

Plasma insulin concentration was acutely raised and maintained at 126 +/- 6 microU/ml and plasma glucose was held constant at the fasting level by a variable glucose infusion. Glucose uptake of 6.53 +/- 0.80 mg X kg-1 X min-1 was unchanged by hyperketonemia when compared with an intraindividual control study using saline instead of beta-OH-butyrate infusion (6.26 +/- 0.59 mg X kg-1 X min-1). In studies, in which the degree of metabolic alkalosis accompanying butyrate infusion was mimicked by the continuous administration of bicarbonate, glucose uptake was also unaffected (6.25 +/- 0.45 mg X kg-1 X min-1). Furthermore, hyperketonemia had no effect on basal glucose production or the suppression of hepatic glucose production following hyperinsulinemia.

In controls, 24% of blastocysts failed to develop successfully when grown for 72 h in Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Insulin at concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 IU/ml of culture medium interfered with development in 62-63% of the blastocysts. Preimplantation embryos showed a threshold pattern in their reaction to glucagon: its addition in concentrations of 0.0015 mM (5 micrograms/ml) did not significantly inhibit blastocyst development, while concentrations of 0.003 mM (10 micrograms/ml) inhibited 70% of blastocysts. The embryotoxic effects of ketone bodies were manifested only in relatively high doses. beta-hydroxybutyrate was embryotoxic at concentrations greater than 5 mg/ml, and its effects were dose dependent: 48 mM (6 mg/ml) inhibited 45% of blastocysts, while 80 mM (10 mg/ml) arrested 87% of embryos from further development. Acetoacetate at concentrations of 0.1 mM (10 micrograms/ml) inhibited the development of 50% of the blastocysts, and its effects were not dose dependent: concentrations of 1 mM (100 micrograms/ml) inhibited development in 63% of the embryos.

3579962,Functional role of aerobic glycolysis in rat portal vein.,"The functional role of aerobic lactate production in the rat portal vein was investigated. Changing substrate from glucose (11.5 mM) to pyruvate (11.5 mM) or beta-hydroxybutyrate (3 mM) had virtually no effect on spontaneous mechanical activity. Lactate production (FLA) was smaller with pyruvate than with glucose (0.05 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.14 +/- 0.03 mumol g-1 min-1, n = 4). Addition of 0.5 mM iodoacetate to inhibit glycolysis abolished mechanical activity in 15-20 min with glucose as substrate, whereas with pyruvate the mechanical activity was only moderately reduced over this time period. With beta-hydroxybutyrate (3 mM) as substrate no aerobic lactate production was detected during normal spontaneous activity. Inhibition of cellular respiration with increasing concentrations of cyanide in beta-hydroxybutyrate medium led to a graded decrease in mechanical activity and FO2, but only a marginal increase in lactate production. With glucose as substrate, repeated stimulation with a combination of isoproterenol (10(-5) M) and papaverine (10(-4) M) gave similar increases in lactate production at each exposure. With beta-hydroxybutyrate some lactate production was found at the first stimulation, but decreased to be abolished at the third stimulation. The mechanical inhibition caused by the stimulation was however similar at the three exposures for both substrates. Lactate production induced by cAMP-raising stimulation in beta-hydroxybutyrate could be accounted for by glycogenolysis. These results show that aerobic glycolysis leading to net lactate production is not necessary for normal spontaneous mechanical activity or the relaxing effect of hypoxia or cAMP raising stimuli in rat portal vein.",0,pigeon; rat heart mitochondria,animal; in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal; Animal – Rat,"limitation of tricarboxylic acid cycle flux, down",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
3666283,Stoichiometric traps in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. I. Self-inhibition and triggering phenomena.,"The steady-state oxidation of 2 mM pyruvate in pigeon and rat heart mitochondria in the presence of ADP-glucose-hexokinase load can be strongly inhibited by excess (10-40 mM) of pyruvate or beta-hydroxybutyrate. This inhibition is accompanied by the accumulation of alpha-ketoglutarate and a decrease of malate. The mechanism of such substrate inhibition may be associated with the limitation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux by low levels of oxaloacetate and free CoA due to their being trapped as alpha-ketoglutarate and acetyl-CoA. Contrary to pyruvate, the ketone bodies in the absence of other substrates produce self-inhibition of their oxidation at as low concentrations as 0.5-1 mM. At 10-15 mM of acetoacetate, a complete suppression of respiration may develop. At a high load (preset by ADP or the uncoupler CCCP), the suppression is characterised by the accumulation of malate and a decrease of alpha-ketoglutarate. At low loads, the reverse distribution of the intermediates takes place. It is concluded that the system of ketone body oxidation in heart mitochondria is an example of biochemical triggers (systems with two alternative stable states).",BCAT2; BCAT1; BCKDHA; 0,extensor digitorum communis muscles from fed chicks; muscles from 24-hr fasted chicks,animal,Animal – Other Mammal; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"leucine oxidative decarboxylation, down",Metabolic Regulation,extensor digitorum communis muscles,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

The animals were treated from day 2 to day 35 after birth either by a daily injection of 50 mg/kg PhB or by saline. The rats were studied at 5 postnatal stages: 7, 10, 14, 21 and 35 days. Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate levels reached their peak values between 10 and 14 days after birth. The concentration of both ketone bodies was significantly higher in PhB- than in saline-treated rats between 10 and 35 days after birth. The total incorporation of [3-14C]beta-hydroxybutyrate into amino acids reached a peak value at 14 days after birth and was down to very low values at 35 days. It was higher in PhB- than in saline-treated rats. The specific radioactivity values of glutamate, glutamine, aspartate and GABA were significantly higher in PhB- than in saline-treated especially at 10 days after birth.

On the morning of day 4, baseline blood and urine samples were collected during three 30-minute periods. Na BOHB (1 mmol/kg, pH = 7.4) was then infused over 20 minutes, and this was followed by a continuous infusion at the rate of 10 mumol/kg min for 160 minutes. Urinary ammonia excretion decreased by 35% (P less than 0.001) while urine pH rose slightly from 5.49 to 5.82 (P less than 0.002). Venous pH increased from 7.31 to 7.38 (P less than 0.005) and bicarbonate concentration from 19 to 25 mEq/L (P less than 0.002).

Three subjects were restudied with sodium bicarbonate (0.52 to 0.85 mEq/min) infusion. Despite similar increases in blood pH and plasma bicarbonate concentration as observed with Na beta-OHB at pH = 7.4, urinary ammonia excretion did not fall significantly.

3788845,Glucocorticoid toxicity in the hippocampus: reversal by supplementation with brain fuels.,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) can damage neurons of the hippocampus, the principal target tissue in the brain for the hormone. Hippocampal neuron loss during aging in the rat is accelerated by prolonged GC exposure and decelerated by adrenalectomy. GCs appear to damage these neurons indirectly by inducing a state of vulnerability and thus impairing their capacity to survive a variety of metabolic challenges. As such, high physiological concentrations of the steroid increase hippocampal damage induced by an antimetabolite toxin, an excitotoxin, or hypoxia-ischemia. Conversely, adrenalectomy attenuates the damage caused by these insults. This study suggests that GCs endanger hippocampal neurons by impairing their energy metabolism. Neurons are extremely vulnerable to such disruption, all the insults potentiated by GCs either impair energy production or pathologically increase energy consumption, and GCs inhibit glucose utilization in the hippocampus. Administration of different brain fuels--glucose, mannose, fructose, or the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate--reduced hippocampal damage induced by coadministration of GCs and either of 2 different neurotoxins (kainic acid and 3-acetylpyridine). This appeared to be due to a reduction in the damaging synergy between GCs and the toxin; as evidence, a dose of mannose that attenuated damage induced by kainic acid plus GCs failed to reduce damage induced by the same dose of kainic acid alone. Glucose (whose utilization is noncompetitively inhibited by GCs) and fructose (which does not readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier) were less effective at reducing damage than the other 2 fuels.",0,whole rat embryos (day 9.5),animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"synergistic dysmorphogenesis, up","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",embryo,Systemic/Whole organism,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Teratogenesis,Genetic / Congenital,"growth, down; organogenesis, down","Body weight, down; Organogenesis, down","D,L sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate",Multi-source,racemic

Synergistic dysmorphogenic effects occurred when minimally teratogenic concentrations of glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate were combined. Sera from diabetic animals containing somatomedin inhibitor bioactivity were also able to produce growth retardation and major developmental lesions in presence of amounts of glucose and ketones which of themselves were not teratogenic. Thus, aberrant fuels and fuel-related products can impair growth and organogenesis in early post-implantation embryo.

Also, at 15 days, stomach volume at the termination of intake was less following nutritive preloads. In a separate experiment with 6-day-old pups, gastric preloads of an alternative energy source, the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate, also failed to inhibit intake when given at a dose that did not cause excessive gastric distension.

It has previously been shown to increase hypoxic survival time and reduce neurologic deficit in several experimental preparations. The aim of this study was to determine if the mechanism of 1,3-butanediol-induced cerebral protection was elevation of blood ketone levels, blood glucagon levels, or both. Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, glucagon levels, or both produced by a previously reported protective dose of 1,3-butanediol (47 mmol/kg) were simulated by direct i.v. infusion of the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate and glucagon separately and in combination, and the effect on hypoxic survival time in instrumented Levine rats (unilateral carotid ligation and hypoxic exposure) was determined. To test if the mechanism was a direct or osmotic effect of the alcohol, an equimolar dose of ethanol (47 mmol/kg) was administered and the effect on hypoxic survival time was compared with that produced by 1,3-butanediol. As in previous studies, 1,3-butanediol significantly increased hypoxic survival time (241% of control, Scheffe p less than 0.05). Various doses of beta-hydroxybutyrate and glucagon were infused to approximate the blood levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and glucagon produced by a protective dose of 1,3-butanediol. Although beta-hydroxybutyrate or glucagon infusions produced blood levels of these substances that were comparable with those produced by administering butanediol, they failed to prolong hypoxic survival time as long as 1,3-butanediol. No correlation was detected between hypoxic survival time and blood levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucagon, insulin, or glucose.

To investigate intestinal consumption of intravenously administered nutrients, uptake of three principal fuels determined from in vitro studies was quantitated in seven awake, unrestrained dogs. Portal blood flow was measured by a dye dilution technique and, simultaneously, substrate samples were obtained from chronic indwelling arterial and portal venous catheters. Studies were performed during a postabsorptive basal period and during separate infusions of glutamine (0.10 mmol/kg X min), glucose (0.10 mmol/kg X min), and beta-hydroxybutyrate, (0.40 mmol/kg X min). During the basal period there was a significant arterial-portal vein gradient for glucose (144 +/- 26 mumol/liter) and glutamine (49 +/- 11 mumol/liter).

Changes in insulin receptor binding and the existence of postreceptor alterations have been proposed. In an attempt to clarify the role of low pH and ketone bodies in the insulin resistance, we examined the effectiveness of insulin during and after 48 h of exposure of cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes to low pH and ketoacids. In the ""acute"" stage, lowering of physiologic pH (pH 7.4) to pH 6.9 induced a decrease in insulin binding (50%), which was due to a decrease in the rate of association. Concomitantly, the insulin sensitivity was decreased (ninefold). The basal hexose uptake and insulin responsiveness were only slightly decreased at low pH. Beta-hydroxybutyrate partially counteracted the effect of low pH on insulin binding and sensitivity in a dose-dependent fashion (ED50: 10 mM). The binding-enhancing effect of ketoacids was more pronounced at low pH than at physiologic pH and absent at optimum pH (pH 8.0). After 48 h of exposure of the cells to pH 6.9, insulin binding and insulin sensitivity (measured at physiologic pH) were similar as in cells cultured at pH 7.4. The insulin response, however, was substantially impaired (40%), due to an increase in basal hexose uptake as well as a decrease in maximal insulin-stimulated uptake. These postbinding alterations induced by low pH could be reversed by culturing the cells at physiologic pH for another 48 h. Prolonged exposure to ketoacids did not affect the insulin effectiveness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,pregnant ewe,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"placental transfer, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,ovine placenta,Placenta/Decidua,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"perinatal mortality, up","Mortality, up",infused for 2 hours at a rate of 0.39 mmol/100 ml of uterine blood flow into both left and right uterine arteries,Intravenous BHB,NS

Previous studies have demonstrated that beta-hydroxybutyrate, a major ketone body, crosses the ovine placenta in significant amounts, leading to significant reductions in fetal PaO2 and increased fetal heart rate. In the present study the pregnant ewe was used to evaluate the maternal and fetal cardiovascular and metabolic responses to hyperketonemia in the presence of hyperglycemia and to determine if the combined diabetic insults were more detrimental to the fetus than hyperketonemia alone. A glucose priming dose of 25 gm was administered in the maternal femoral vein followed by a continuous glucose infusion of 200 mg/min to achieve steady maternal plasma glucose levels of 180 mg/dl. Once glucose levels were stable, beta-hydroxybutyrate was infused for 2 hours at a rate of 0.39 mmol/100 ml of uterine blood flow into both left and right uterine arteries. Infusion of glucose alone did not significantly alter fetal cardiovascular and blood gas parameters but did increase the fetal glucose level from 17 +/- 4 to 58 +/- 8 mg/dl. The simultaneous infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate and glucose produced significant decreases in fetal PaO2 and oxygen content as were reported for hyperketonemia alone and significant time-related increases in fetal lactate levels and fetal heart rate. These data suggest that hyperketonemia in the pregnant ewe leads to quantitatively similar changes in oxygenation in both normoglycemic and hyperglycemic fetuses. These observations may in part help explain the increased perinatal mortality in the pregnant woman with uncontrolled diabetes.",0; FBP1,rat hepatocyte suspensions,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"citrate inhibition of phosphofructokinase, down",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,hepatocyte,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-Hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
3992491,Mechanism for the oleate stimulation of gluconeogenesis from dihydroxyacetone by hepatocytes from fasted rats.,"Oleate stimulates glucose production and concomitantly decreases lactate and pyruvate production by rat hepatocyte suspensions incubated with dihydroxyacetone as substrate. The actions of oleate could be blocked by D-(+)dodecanoylcarnitine, which inhibits transport of the fatty acid into the mitochondria and the subsequent oxidation. beta-Hydroxybutyrate, but not acetoacetate, also stimulated glucose synthesis and inhibited lactate and pyruvate production. Furthermore, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and oleate stimulated oxygen consumption to the same extent. This suggests that oleate stimulates glucose production by the provision of energy subsequent to mitochondrial beta-oxidation of the fatty acids. The content of ATP itself did not appear to be responsible for the effects of oleate. Crossover analysis of the gluconeogenic intermediates implicated a site of oleate action between fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 6-phosphate, suggesting phosphofructokinase and/or fructose-bisphosphatase as possible regulatory sites. Coupled with the finding that intracellular citrate accumulates upon addition of oleate or beta-hydroxybutyrate, but not acetoacetate, the results suggest that citrate inhibition of phosphofructokinase accounts for the redirection of carbon flow from lactate and pyruvate formation and towards that of glucose.",0,mouse early-somite embryos; mouse embryos; mouse fetus,animal,Animal – Mouse,"inhibition of glycolysis, down",Metabolic Regulation,embryo,Systemic/Whole organism,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Teratogenicity,Toxicology / Poisoning,"embryonic defects, up","Embryonic defects, up",NS,NS,NS

In an attempt to define this mechanism, the present study investigated the normal pattern of both glucose and B-OHB utilization in the developing embryo and fetus. Furthermore, the metabolic interaction of these two substrates, i.e., the potential for B-OHB to inhibit glycolysis, was studied. All studies compared early and late embryonic periods of development as well as fetal stages. The results show that the early embryo relies almost exclusively on glycolysis for energy metabolism and suggests that there is an increasing importance of the Krebs cycle with increasing gestational age. Similarly, the early embryo has a low capacity to metabolize B-OHB, whereas later gestational stages display a greater rate of utilization. Finally, there appears to be no inhibition of glycolysis by B-OHB (via so-called ""substrate interactions"") during early embryonic stages. However, the compound significantly inhibits glycolysis during later embryonic and fetal stages. These studies suggest that the teratogenicity of B-OHB in the early embryo is not due to its effects on modulating glycolysis, although this mechanism may be operating at later periods of gestation.",0,guinea-pig taenia coli smooth muscle (glycogen-depleted),animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"activation of electrogenic pump, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,taenia coli smooth muscle,Large intestine/Colon,smooth muscle cell,Muscle – Smooth / Perivascular,Visceral smooth muscle,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

The early hyperpolarization was highly temperature dependent, so that below 30 degrees C, substrate application produced the depolarization with a delay of approximately 2 min, without a clear preceding hyperpolarization. The responses to substrate were not affected by ouabain (10 microM). Readmission of K after a treatment with K-free solution for 10 min caused a transient hyperpolarization only in the presence of substrate. This hyperpolarization was abolished by ouabain. Verapamil (0.1 microM) blocked the substrate-induced depolarization, revealing an underlying slow hyperpolarization. Removal of Ca abolished both the hyperpolarization and depolarization caused by substrate application, but the hyperpolarization disappeared much more slowly than the depolarization. Removal of the external K had little effect on the substrate-induced hyperpolarization, but the hyperpolarization induced by substrate application was increased when the external K was increased up to approximately 20 mM. Both the hyperpolarization and the depolarization were not clearly affected by completely replacing Na with choline. The results suggest that ATP supplied by the addition of substrate activates some electrogenic pump, probably a Ca pump, causing hyperpolarization, and that ATP also removes the inactivation of Ca conductance with some delay, resulting in an increased depolarization.",0,canine cardiac Purkinje fibres,animal; in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal,"contractile force, up","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",cardiac Purkinje fibres,Heart,Purkinje fibres,Muscle – Cardiac,Cardiac fibroblasts,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
4062289,Reversal of strophanthidin negative inotropy by metabolic substrates in cardiac Purkinje fibres.,"The action of substrates and metabolic inhibitors on strophanthidin inotropy was studied in canine cardiac Purkinje fibres perfused in vitro. Both membrane potentials and contractile force were recorded. The results show that: 1) pyruvate (1 to 10 mmol X litre-1) decreases and then increases contractile force in Tyrode solution or in the presence of a low concentration of strophanthidin without modifying the action potential magnitude or configuration; 2) during the decreasing (but not the increasing) phase of strophanthidin (2 to 5 X 10(-7) mol X litre-1) inotropy, pyruvate increases contractile force; 3) beta-hydroxybutyrate has effects similar to those of pyruvate; 4) glucose increases contractile force and more so during the descending phase of strophanthidin inotropy; 5) the positive inotropic effect of pyruvate during declining strophanthidin inotropy is not prevented by glucose-lack and/or by iodoacetate but is markedly reduced in a hypoxic solution; 6) in contrast, glucose under similar conditions has the usual effects in hypoxia but not in the presence of iodoacetate; 7) the combination of hypoxia and glucose-lack leads to a decline in contractile force and to contracture: strophanthidin increases both contractile and resting force whereas O2 and/or glucose relax the contracture; 8) pyruvate has a positive inotropic effect also in the presence of high (greater than 10 mmol X litre-1) calcium. It is concluded that the decline in contractile force during exposure to strophanthidin or high calcium can be reversed by providing suitable substrates and therefore may involve a deficit in the production of high energy phosphates.",0,perfused livers from fasted rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"alpha-ketobutyrate decarboxylation, down",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",infusion,NS,NS
4221104,alpha-Ketobutyrate metabolism in perfused rat liver: regulation of alpha-ketobutyrate decarboxylation and effects of alpha-ketobutyrate on pyruvate dehydrogenase.,"The oxidative decarboxylation and subsequent production of glucose from alpha-ketobutyrate were studied using perfused livers from fasted rats. The production of 14CO2 from alpha-keto-[1-14C]butyrate increased monotonically while the production of glucose from alpha-ketobutyrate was biphasic as the perfusate concentration of alpha-ketobutyrate was increased. The biphasic gluconeogenic response using alpha-ketobutyrate as the gluconeogenic precursor was similar to that observed with propionate. The decarboxylation of alpha-ketobutyrate was found to be exquisitely sensitive to the effects of the monocarboxylate transport inhibitor, alpha-cyanocinnamate. Infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate caused a substantial inhibition of alpha-ketobutyrate decarboxylation while dichloroacetate, a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, did not stimulate the metabolism of alpha-ketobutyrate but was inhibitory. The effects of alpha-ketobutyrate infusion on pyruvate decarboxylation were tested and it was found that at low perfusate pyruvate concentrations (ca. 0.25 mM) increasing alpha-ketobutyrate led to increasing inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylation, while at high perfusate pyruvate concentrations (ca. 2.5 mM) an initial inhibition was apparent which did not increase substantially with increasing alpha-ketobutyrate concentrations. The results obtained indicate that the regulation of alpha-ketobutyrate metabolism by oxidative decarboxylation differs significantly from that of pyruvate. In addition, while the rate of gluconeogenesis using alpha-ketobutyrate as a precursor was remarkably similar to that using propionate as a gluconeogenic precursor, the effects of alpha-ketobutyrate on the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate were qualitatively different from the effects of propionate on pyruvate metabolism.",0,mouse; epididymal fat pads,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"free fatty acid release, up",Metabolic Regulation,epididymal fat pads,Adipose tissue,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",DL-Beta-hydroxybutyrate-3-(14)C,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic
4327575,Factors influencing the utilization of ketone bodies by mouse adipose tissue.,"Factors influencing the utilization of ketone bodies by mouse adipose tissue in vitro were studied. Epididymal fat pads can oxidize DL-Beta-hydroxybutyrate-3-(14)C and acetoacetate-3-(14)C to (14)CO(2) as well as convert these compounds to fatty acid-(14)C. An increased output of (14)CO(2) from Beta-hydroxybutyrate-3-(14)C was noted in response to glucose plus insulin, succinate, oxaloacetate, L-asparate, and L-malate. Fatty acid synthesis from Beta-hydroxybutyrate was enhanced by glucose plus insulin, L-aspartate, L-malate, oxaloacetate, and citrate. Nicotinamide stimulated the oxidation of Beta-hydroxybutyrate but not of acetoacetate to CO(2), and did not affect fatty acid synthesis from either ketone body. Nicotinamide increased NAD(+) and NADP(+) levels in epididymal fat pads without affecting the concentration of NADH and NADPH. ""Superlipogenesis"" caused by fasting the mice for 48 hr and re-feeding them for 24 hr sharply enhanced CO(2) output and lipogenesis from Beta-hydroxybutyrate. The activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconic dehydrogenase, NADP-malic dehydrogenase, and citrate cleavage enzyme from mouse adipose tissue were increased during ""superlipogenesis."" Free fatty acid release by epididymal fat pads in vitro was slightly increased by Beta-hydroxybutyrate.

4347969,The effect of ketone bodies on renal ammoniogenesis.,"Infusion of ketone bodies to ammonium chloride-loaded acidotic dogs was found to induce significant reduction in urinary excretion of ammonia. This effect could not be attributed to urinary pH variations. Total ammonia production by the left kidney was measured in 25 animals infused during 90 min with the sodium salt of D,L-beta-hydroxybutyric acid adjusted to pH 6.0 or 4.2. Ketonemia averaged 4.5 mM/liter. In all experiments the ammonia content of both urine and renal venous blood fell markedly so that ammoniogenesis was depressed by 60% or more within 60 min after the onset of infusion. Administration of equimolar quantities of sodium acetoacetate adjusted to pH 6.0 resulted in a 50% decrease in renal ammonia production. Infusion of ketone bodies adjusted to pH 6.0 is usually accompanied by a small increase in extracellular bicarbonate (3.7 mM/liter). However infusion of D,L-sodium lactate or sodium bicarbonate in amounts sufficient to induce a similar rise in plasma bicarbonate resulted in only a slight decrement in ammonia production (15%). The continuous infusion of 5% mannitol alone during 90-150 min failed to influence renal ammoniogenesis. Infusion of pure sodium-free beta-hydroxybutyric acid prepared by ion exchange (pH 2.2) resulted in a 50% decrease in renal ammoniogenesis in spite of the fact that both urinary pH and plasma bicarbonate fell significantly. During all experiments where ketones were infused, the renal extraction of glutamine became negligible as the renal glutamine arteriovenous difference was abolished. Renal hemodynamics did not vary significantly. Infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate into the left renal artery resulted in a rapid decrease in ammoniogenesis by the perfused kidney. The present study indicates that ketone bodies exert their inhibitory influence within the renal tubular cell. Since their effect is independent of urinary or systemic acid-base changes, it is suggested that they depress renal ammoniogenesis by preventing the transformation of glutamine and glutamate into alpha-ketoglutarate in the mitochondria of the renal tubular cell.",0; G6PD; BDH1; ALDOA; FBP1,Azotobacter vinelandii cells,NS,Animal – Invertebrate,"encystment, up","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",NS,NS,Azotobacter vinelandii cells,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

The process of differentiation, which occurs over a period of 36 h, was characterized by an ordered sequence of biochemical events. Upon initiation of encystment, nitrogen fixation and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities decreased immediately to very low levels. This was followed by an increase in the specific activities of BHB dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, isocitrate lyase, and malate synthase first at 3 h and then again at 21 h. The peak activity of fructose 1,6-diphosphate aldolase occurred at 6 h, and the enzyme activity then decreased gradually. Fructose 1,6-diphosphatase had peak activities at 9 and 27 h. Deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis ceased just prior to the final cell division at 4 to 6 h, but ribonucleic acid synthesis continued until the 12th h.

Acetoacetate or dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate increases the rate of oxygen consumption to a smaller extent than that brought about by glucose or pyruvate in adult rat brain-cortex slices but to the same extent as that in infant rat brain-cortex slices. 2. The rate of (14)CO(2) evolution from [1-(14)C]glucose considerably exceeds that from [6-(14)C]glucose in respiring infant rat brain-cortex slices, in contrast with adult brain-cortex slices, suggesting that the hexose monophosphate shunt operates at a greater rate in the infant rat brain than in the adult rat brain. 3. The rate of (14)CO(2) evolution from [3-(14)C]acetoacetate or dl-beta-hydroxy[3-(14)C]butyrate, in the absence of glucose, is the same in infant rat brain slices as in adult rat brain slices. It exceeds that from [2-(14)C]glucose in infant rat brain but is less than that from [2-(14)C]glucose in adult rat brain. 4. Acetoacetate is oxidized in the brain through the operation of the citric acid cycle, as shown by the accelerating effect of glucose on acetoacetate oxidation in adult brain slices, by the inhibitory effects of malonate in both infant and adult brain slices and by its conversion into glutamate and related amino acids in both tissues. 5. Acetoacetate does not affect glucose utilization in adult or infant brain slices. It inhibits the rate of (14)CO(2) formation from [2-(14)C]glucose or [U-(14)C]-glucose the effect not being wholly due to isotopic dilution. 6. Acetoacetate inhibits non-competitively the oxidation of [1-(14)C]pyruvate, the effect being attributed to competition between acetyl-CoA and CoA for the pyruvate-oxidation system. 7. Acetoacetate increases the rate of aerobic formation of lactate from glucose with both adult and infant rat brain slices. 8. The presence of 0.1mm-2,4-dinitrophenol diminishes but does not abolish the rate of (14)CO(2) formation from [3-(14)C]acetoacetate in rat brain slices. This points to the participation of ATP in the process of oxidation of acetoacetate in infant or adult rat brain. 9. The presence of 5mm-d-glutamate inhibits the rate of (14)CO(2) formation from [3-(14)C]acetoacetate, in the presence or absence of glucose. 10. Labelled amino acids are formed from [3-(14)C]acetoacetate in both adult and infant rat brain-cortex slices, but the amounts are smaller than those found with [2-(14)C]glucose in adult rat brain and greater than those found with [2-(14)C]glucose in infant rat brain. 11. Acetoacetate is not as effective as glucose as a precursor of acetylcholine in adult rat brain but is as effective as glucose in infant rat brain slices. 12.

Butyraldehyde and butyrate did not influence the extent of encystment. In the absence of glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate enhanced the rate and extent of encystment. In the presence of glucose, it promoted abortive encystment, which was manifested by the disorganization of the exine and the release of a highly viscous material into the medium. The soluble, viscous polymer was separated from the medium by a series of ethyl alcohol precipitations and identified as a mucopeptide. It was cleaved by treatment with lysozyme and lysostaphin with a concomitant increase in reducing power. It contained 13.9% N; 56% amino acids, as alanine (alanine, lysine, and glutamic acids); and 42% hexosamines.

The role of the hormonal response to the ketone infusion was assessed by controlling the hormone levels pharmacologically. In one group hormones were not controlled, while in the other two groups insulin and glucagon were maintained at constant levels by infusion of somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon at constant rates. In one of these hormonally controlled groups, combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade was also employed. BOHB infusion increased total ketone concentration approximately 10-fold and, when hormones were not controlled, induced a significant increase in glucagon concentration. Regardless of hormonal status, elevation of the ketone levels decreased the rate of glucose production and FFA appearance. Glucose oxidation decreased in proportion to the reduction in the rate of glucose uptake in all groups. When sympathetic activity was not blocked an increase in the percent of FFA uptake oxidized enabled the percent CO2 production from FFA oxidation to remain constant despite the decrease in FFA uptake. However, when sympathetic activity was blocked the increase in the percent of FFA uptake oxidized observed in the other groups was prevented.

We found (1) that the addition of 10 mM DL-BOH to the perfusate augmented somatostatin secretion from the normal dog pancreas. The responses obtained were, however, modified by the prevailing glucose level with higher responses appearing at high (11 mM) rather than at zero glucose. The effect of BOH could not be attributed to changes in osmolarity, Na+, or H+ concentrations. (2) BOH at doses well within the physiologic and pathophysiologic range stimulated the secretion of somatostatin from the normal pancreas in a dose-dependent manner. The threshold concentration was close to 1 mM corresponding to 0.5 mM of the biologically active D form. (3) In the STZ-diabetic dogs, BOH (1-20 mM) elicits a dose-related enhancement of the pancreatic somatostatin secretion. In the two groups, identical D-cell responses were obtained at 3, 10, and 20 mM BOH. The results demonstrate that physiologic levels of BOH stimulates the release of somatostatin from pancreas of normal and STZ-diabetic dogs, thereby providing support for a physiologic influence of BOH over the secretory function of the pancreatic D-cell.

6180645,Effects of pyruvate and other metabolites on cyclic GMP levels in incubations of rat hepatocytes and kidney cortex.,"Pyruvate increased cyclic GMP levels in rat hepatocytes. The effects were observed without or with 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. Lactate, acetate, oxaloacetate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate also increased cyclic GMP levels. Some compounds increased cyclic GMP in kidney cortex slices. The effects were dependent upon Ca2+ in the medium. Cyclic AMP was increased 30-50% by some of these substances with 2.6 mM Ca2+. Rotenone, oligomycin, antimycin, dinitrophenol, KCN, and arsenate decreased GTP and ATP, basal cyclic GMP and the pyruvate effect, but did not alter cyclic AMP. Although fluoroacetate alone had no effect on cyclic nucleotides, GTP, or ATP, it potentiated the pyruvate effect on cyclic GMP. Adenosine and guanosine increased cyclic GMP and GTP to a similar extent of 30-50%. Aminooxyacetate, cycloserine, pentenoic acid and mepacrine decreased the pyruvate effect while cycloserine or mepacrine alone increased cyclic GMP. Citrate and mepacrine inhibited soluble and particulate guanylate cyclase from rat liver while cycloserine and acetoacetate increased guanylate cyclase activity. None of the other compounds altered guanylate cyclase activity.

6201398,Fetal fuels. V. Ketone bodies inhibit pyrimidine biosynthesis in fetal rat brain.,"Ketonemic states complicating late pregnancy are accompanied by lower brain weights in the newborn. Potential mechanisms whereby ketone bodies might inhibit cell proliferation were therefore examined in the fetal rat brain slice by measuring their impact on the de novo pathway for pyrimidine biosynthesis. DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (10.8 mM) and acetoacetate (5.4 mM) were both found to diminish the incorporation of NaH14CO3 into [14C]UMP by 30%. This effect was similar in fetal tissues from fed and 48-h starved mothers. Graded concentrations of DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (1.4-43.2 mM) resulted in a progressive inhibition that could not be explained either by isotope dilution consequent to ketone body oxidation or by a generalized inhibition of protein synthesis. The inhibition was not reversed with 10 mM glutamine, the principal nitrogen substrate for de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines. When the conversion of orotic acid into UMP was blocked with 6-azauridine, DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (10.8 mM) inhibited the incorporation of NaH14CO3 into orotic acid by 28%. By contrast, maximally inhibitory concentrations of this ketone body (43.2 mM) had no effect on the incorporation of [6-14C]orotic acid into [14C]UMP.

Unlike freshly isolated cardiac muscle cells which oxidize glucose preferentially, the cultured cells more closely resemble metabolically the in situ heart and the isolated perfused heart, in that their preference for exogenous substrates is in the order of fatty acid greater than glucose. This switch in metabolic preference from glucose to fatty acid is complete within 12 h after placing freshly isolated cells in culture. Glucose oxidation is stimulated by insulin and isoproterenol and inhibited by beta-hydroxybutyrate and octanoate. The adenylate cyclase system has also been examined in these cultured cells. Isoproterenol, norepinephrine and epinephrine stimulate the accumulation of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in a concentration-dependent manner. The order of potency is isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine approximately equal to epinephrine.

These inhibitory effects are offset if respiration is supported by succinate in presence of rotenone provided that a substrate (beta-hydroxybutyrate) is provided to maintain the reduction of NADH.

6309158,Failure of infused beta-hydroxybutyrate to decrease proteolysis in man.,"Ketone bodies have been suggested to have a protein-sparing effect, since infusion of Na-beta-hydroxybutyrate in man decreases plasma alanine concentrations and urinary nitrogen (N) excretion. To test this hypothesis, six normal postabsorptive volunteers were infused with Na-beta-hydroxybutyrate for 3 h. Rates of glucose, leucine carbon, and alanine appearance and disappearance from the plasma space were traced with [3-3H]glucose, L-[6,6,6-2H3]leucine, and [2,3,3,3-2H4]alanine. Rates of leucine N appearance and disappearance and the rate of transfer of leucine N to alanine were assessed with [15N]leucine. During ketone body infusion, plasma alanine decreased (P less than 0.05), whereas plasma leucine increased (P less than 0.05). Rates of alanine appearance increased (5.3 +/- 0.3 to 7.8 +/- 0.6 mumol/kg X min), but the increase in its rate of disappearance was slightly greater, accounting for the decrease in plasma alanine concentration. Leucine N flux and the rate and percent of leucine N transferred to alanine increased, whereas leucine carbon flux was unchanged. To determine the effect of the alkalemia induced by Na-beta-hydroxybutyrate, four additional subjects were infused with NaHCO3. Alkalemia had no effect on leucine N or carbon flux or on the rate of appearance of alanine, but increased the rate of alanine disappearance, resulting in a decrease in the plasma alanine concentration. Since the rate of appearance of leucine carbon was unaltered during the infusion of Na-beta-hydroxybutyrate, it is unlikely that hyperketonemia per se decreases proteolysis in postabsorptive man.",0,rat; isolated liver mitochondria,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"hydrogen supply, down",Ion & Nutrient Transport,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio in the incubation medium,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Hydrogen supply was changed by variation of the beta-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio in the incubation medium. In the active state respiration rate was strongly diminished by lowering the beta-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio, whereas in the resting state a minor effect was observed. This resulted in a decrease in the respiratory control index (RCI). Even under a metabolic situation of strongly diminished hydrogen supply corresponding to a beta-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio equal to 0.5 added ADP was phosphorylated. However, the ATP/ADP ratio generated extramitochondrially amounted to half that obtained at a beta-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio of more than 100. Nevertheless at a beta-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio of 0.5 the generated extramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio is near to 100. A comparison of the changes in the available free redox energy with those in the extramitochondrial phosphorylation potential points to a disequilibrium between them in the resting state, too.

Incorporation of 3H-uridine into RNA by peritubular cells cultured in simulated diabetic conditions was also studied. The cells were exposed to various concentrations of glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, sodium bicarbonate (to alter the pH of the medium), mannitol (to influence the osmolarity of the medium), or a combination of these compounds. All of the metabolic parameters when tested alone or in combination were capable of increasing lactate secretion by Sertoli cells above control values. Basal secretion of androgen-binding protein, however, was not influenced by an individual component or when all components were tested together. FSH-stimulated levels of androgen-binding protein secretion was depressed only when the Sertoli cells were exposed to all the components simultaneously. Incorporation of uridine by peritubular cells was decreased by exposing the cells to butyrate or mannitol, while no effect was observed with glucose treatment. These results indicate that Sertoli cell and peritubular cell function can be directly altered by several specific metabolic parameters associated with diabetes.",GH1; GCG,10 healthy men,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"GH secretion, down",Hormonal Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",intravenous infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Intravenous infusion of nicotinic acid induced suppression of both FFA and ketone bodies. This was accompanied by a delayed GH increase to 21.1 +/- 6.9 ng/ml (at 300 min). During an additional beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHB) infusion, FFA remained depressed, but ketone bodies were elevated, and the GH response was abolished (maximum 5.6 +/- 1.6 ng/ml). During infusion of OHB alone, FFA were suppressed. GH increased significantly, although less markedly than during suppression of both FFA and ketone bodies (to 9.3 +/- 3.1 ng/ml at 270 min). No GH rise occurred when both FFA and ketone bodies were kept elevated by the addition of a lipid infusion. The GH rise in response to insulin hypoglycemia was not changed by an OHB infusion (43.2 +/- 4.6 vs. 48.0 +/- 7.3 ng/ml). However, OHB increased the net GH output by significantly delaying the return to basal concentrations in the presence of a reduced FFA rebound. An effect of OHB infusion on the plasma glucagon concentration during all experiments was small, and its physiological significance is doubtful. These results confirm that FFA depression induces delayed GH secretion. They suggest that this is not wholly dependent on concomitant depression of ketone bodies. On the other hand, when ketone bodies are elevated, the GH response to FFA depression is diminished or absent. The net GH response to changes in lipid substrates probably depends on the concentration of both FFA and ketone bodies.",INS,four infants (3-32 months) with persistent hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinism of neonatal onset,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"gluconeogenesis, up",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypoglycemia; Congenital hyperinsulinism,Metabolic & Endocrine,"plasma glucose, up","Blood glucose, up",sodium DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

Fasting hypoglycemia was found to be due both to an insulin-induced decrease in hepatic glucose output to 3.95 +/- 0.30 (SEM) mg/kg X min, a value about two thirds of normal, and to a glucose utilization rate of 4.25 +/- 0.32 mg/kg X min, which exceeded glucose production by about 8%. Simultaneously, and despite hypoglycemia, fasting plasma D-beta-hydroxybutyric acid concentrations were inappropriately low: 406 +/- 146 microM, presumably the result of elevated circulating insulin levels. The infusion of sodium DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate resulted in an increase of plasma glucose (48 +/- 7 vs. 32 +/- 7 mg/dl, P less than 0.01) and lactate (1704 +/- 217 vs. 964 +/- 149 microM, P less than 0.005), without detectable changes in insulin secretion estimated from circulating C-peptide values. Unexpectedly, the increase of plasma glucose was due to the restoration of glucose production up to 6.7 +/- 0.2 mg/kg X min. The individual increments of plasma lactate and glucose production rate were linearly correlated (P less than 0.01). These results together with the known inhibitory effect of ketone bodies on pyruvate dehydrogenation, suggest both increased production of lactate from peripheral recycling of glucose carbon and an increased conversion of this gluconeogenic precursor into glucose.",0,mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"substrate availability, up",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypoxia,General Signs & Symptoms,"hypoxic survival time, up","Survival, up","1,3-butanediol; beta-hydroxybutyrate administration","1,3-Butanediol (BD); Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid)",NS
6389223,"Role of tissue lactate and substrate availability in 1,3-butanediol-enhanced hypoxic survival in the mouse.","Previously we found that 1,3-butanediol-treated mice live longer during hypoxia. We hypothesized that 1,3-butanediol could reduce the brain's accumulation of potentially cytotoxic lactate and/or elevate brain substrate availability (ketones or glucose) and thus maintain the brain's energy producing capability even during reduced oxygen availability. To test these hypotheses, whole brain metabolites from normoxic and hypoxic mice, pretreated with 1,3-butanediol or insulin, were compared to saline controls. During hypoxia both pretreated groups had lower brain lactate than controls. If lactate accumulation was the sole factor responsible for hypoxic tolerance, insulin should have increased brain lactate since insulin has been shown previously to reduce hypoxic tolerance. In normoxic mice the ratio of lactate to pyruvate and the level of malate and fumarate were not changed by 1,3-butanediol as is found with other agents known to protect the hypoxic animal. When substrate availability was directly elevated by beta-hydroxybutyrate and glucose administration hypoxic survival time increased thus implicating substrate availability as an important factor in hypoxic tolerance. We conclude that reduced brain lactate and augmented substrate availability both contribute to 1,3-butanediol-enhanced hypoxic tolerance in this animal model.",0; SLC2A1; INSR,adipocytes,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"post-insulin receptor level, up",Metabolic Regulation,adipocytes,Adipose tissue,adipocytes,Adipose,White adipocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",sodium-DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic
6408343,beta-Hydroxybutyrate increases the insulin sensitivity of adipocyte glucose transport at a postreceptor level.,"The effect of insulin on glucose transport (2-deoxyglucose uptake) in adipocytes was measured in the absence and in the presence of 10 mM sodium-DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate. The ketone body had little or no effect on the basal or the maximally insulin-stimulated rate of transport. However, beta-hydroxybutyrate potentiated the effect of submaximal concentrations of insulin, i.e., it resulted in a leftward shift in the dose-response curve. The half-maximally effective concentration of insulin was decreased by approximately 30% from 0.58 ng/ml to 0.40 ng/ml. beta-Hydroxybutyrate caused a slight (approximately 10%) increase in 125I-insulin binding to the cells. To determine whether this small increase in insulin binding is responsible for the increased insulin sensitivity in the presence of the ketone, two mimickers of insulin action were used: a serum containing anti-insulin receptor antibodies and hydrogen peroxide. beta-Hydroxybutyrate increased the sensitivity of glucose transport to stimulation by the anti-receptor antibody, demonstrating that insulin itself does not have to be present. beta-Hydroxybutyrate also potentiated the effect of hydrogen peroxide (which acts at a level distal to the insulin receptor) even in cells that had been depleted of insulin receptors by trypsin treatment. Therefore, beta-hydroxybutyrate acts, at least partly, at a post-insulin receptor level.

Metabolism of pyruvate, branched-chain alpha-keto acids, acetoacetate and, to a lesser extent beta-hydroxybutyrate, were all inhibited by cyclopropane carboxylate. In addition, the stimulation of pyruvate decarboxylation by beta-hydroxybutyrate at low pyruvate concentrations because of exchange of extramitochondrial pyruvate with intramitochondrially generated acetoacetate, was abolished by cyclopropane carboxylate. Gluconeogenesis from alanine, which is not transported via the monocarboxylate translocator, was not inhibited by low concentrations of cyclopropane carboxylate. Cyclopropane carboxylate also inhibited fatty acid oxidation, as measured by ketone body production. These results support previous findings that the hypoglycemic agent, cyclopropane carboxylate, exerts at least some of its metabolic effects at the level of the mitochondrial monocarboxylate transporter.",0,rat pups; hypothyroid rat pups (dams fed 0.02% propylthiouracil during pregnancy and lactation),animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"substrate availability, down",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypothyroidism,Metabolic & Endocrine,"brain lipid content, down","Lipid profile, down",14C-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

In the in vitro studies, the oxidation of BOHB to CO2 was lower at 14 and 21 days of age in hypothyroid pups than in pair-fed controls but higher at 35 days. The incorporation of BOHB into brain lipid was significantly higher in hypothyroid pups at 14, 21 and 35 days. In contrast, in the in vivo studies, incorporation of BOHB into lipid was significantly lower in hypothyroid pups at 14 and 21 days. These results suggest that hypothyroid pups may have a normal or increased capability to use BOHB for lipid synthesis, but were unable to achieve normal rates of utilization in vivo, possibly due to a decreased substrate availability. These findings may have implications for the decreased brain lipid content characteristic of neonatal hypothyroidism.",0,perfused rat liver,animal,Animal – Rat,"reduction of the mitochondrial NAD(H) redox couple, down",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,perfused rat liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",Infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
6422588,Regulation of the glycine cleavage system in the isolated perfused rat liver.,"The catabolism of glycine in the isolated perfused rat liver was investigated by measuring the production of 14CO2 from [1-14C]- and [2-14C]glycine. Production of 14CO2 from [1-14C]glycine was maximal as the perfusate glycine concentration approached 10 mM and exhibited a maximal activity of 125 nmol of 14CO2 X g-1 X min-1 and an apparent Km of approximately 2 mM. Production of 14CO2 from [2-14C]glycine was much lower, approaching a maximal activity of approximately 40 nmol of 14CO2 X g-1 X min-1 at a perfusate glycine concentration of 10 mM, with an apparent Km of approximately 2.5 mM. Washout kinetic experiments with [1-14C]glycine exhibited a single half-time of 14CO2 disappearance, indicating one metabolic pool from which the observed 14CO2 production is derived. These results indicate that the glycine cleavage system is the predominant catabolic fate of glycine in the perfused rat liver and that production of 14CO2 from [1-14C]glycine is an effective monitor of metabolic flux through this system. Metabolic flux through the glycine cleavage system in the perfused rat liver was inhibited by processes which lead to reduction of the mitochondrial NAD(H) redox couple. Infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate or octanoate inhibited 14CO2 production from [1-14C]glycine by 33 and 50%, respectively. Alternatively, infusion of acetoacetate stimulated glycine decarboxylation slightly and completely reversed the inhibition of 14CO2 production by octanoate. Metabolic conditions which are known to cause a large consumption of mitochondrial NADPH (e.g. ureogenesis from ammonia) stimulated glycine decarboxylation by the perfused rat liver. Infusion of pyruvate and ammonium chloride stimulated production of 14CO2 from [1-14C]glycine more than 2-fold. Lactate plus ammonium chloride was equally as effective in stimulating glycine decarboxylation by the perfused rat liver, while alanine plus ammonium chloride was ineffective in stimulating 14CO2 production.",0,mice; rat brain slice,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Multi-model,"carbon dioxide production from beta-hydroxybutyrate, up",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypoxia,General Signs & Symptoms,"survival, up","Survival, up",elevated blood ketones,NS,NS

To evaluate a possible mechanism responsible for this phenomenon a rat brain slice preparation was used to determine if brain tissue would utilize glucose or ketones preferentially during exposure to reduced oxygen. Reducing available oxygen in the incubation medium from 95%, in steps, to 5% produced the expected gradual reduction in the carbon dioxide formation from glucose. In contrast, reducing the oxygen level to 40 and 20% resulted in a statistically significant stimulation of the production of carbon dioxide from the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate. At very low oxygen levels carbon dioxide production from either substrate was reduced. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ketones can be used in addition to glucose as a substrate for brain energy production even during reduced oxygen availability. If the increase in carbon dioxide production from ketones can be equated with an increase in energy production from this supplemental substrate then ketones may be therapeutically useful in avoiding the collapse of brain function during moderate hypoxia.",0,mice; isolated rat brain slices,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Multi-model,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypoxia,General Signs & Symptoms,"hypoxic tolerance, up","Hypoxic tolerance, up",NS,NS,NS
6486793,Glucagon stimulates ketone utilization by rat brain slices.,"Glucagon has been shown previously to increase further the enhanced tolerance for hypoxia observed in mice with elevated blood ketones. Glucagon is also known to increase blood glucose and to alter directly the metabolism of some (liver) cells. Both the increase in blood glucose and altered cellular metabolism could contribute to the increase in tolerance for hypoxia observed in mice given glucagon in combination with the ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate. To evaluate the systemic component of this hypothesis, blood glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and glucagon were elevated alone or simultaneously and hypoxic tolerance of mice was measured. To identify possible cellular effects of glucagon on glucose or ketone metabolism, we measured the incorporation of radiolabeled glucose or beta-hydroxybutyrate into CO2 or total lipid in isolated rat brain slices. Both glucagon and glucose increased hypoxic tolerance of ketotic mice but our data do not support the hypothesis that glucagon's action was only through an elevation of blood glucose. In brain slices glucagon stimulated the incorporation of beta-hydroxybutyrate into CO2 both in the presence or absence of additional glucose. These results demonstrate that glucagon has a direct effect on brain metabolism which may contribute to the increased tolerance for hypoxia. They, however, do not exclude the possibility that glucagon is working in addition to increase hypoxic survival in ketotic mice by increasing the availability of glucose to the brain.",0,fasted rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"regulation at level of various dehydrogenases, NS",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",infusion,NS,NS

With alpha-ketoisovalerate as the gluconeogenic precursor, infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetate stimulated the rate of alpha-ketoisovalerate decarboxylation, but inhibited the rate of glucose production. Oleate, on the other hand, inhibited both alpha-ketoisovalerate decarboxylation and glucose production. When propionate was the primary gluconeogenic substrate, oleate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetate infusion did not significantly alter hepatic glucose production.

6666615,Effects of glucose removal and readmission on potassium contracture in the guinea-pig taenia coli.,"The effects of removal and readmission of substrates on the K contracture were investigated in the guinea-pig taenia coli. When, after exposure to excess K in Ca-free and glucose-free medium, the readmission and removal of 2.4 mM-Ca were repeated at regular intervals, the Ca-induced contractions decreased progressively. The decrease was more marked in the late than in the early part of the tension response. The rate of O2 consumption decreased when the normal medium was replaced by glucose-free, Ca-free, excess-K solution, but substantially recovered following Ca readmission. ATP and creatine phosphate contents decreased during the Ca-induced contraction, but recovered partially during the subsequent relaxation in Ca-free solution. The effects of glucose removal were rapidly reversed when glucose or beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) were readmitted to the bathing solution. In the absence of Ca, readmission and removal of the substrates produced an insignificant change in O2 consumption, but the next Ca contraction was potentiated, the effect being stronger with glucose than beta-HB. When the tonic contraction evoked by 2.4 mM-Ca readmission had been abolished in glucose-free, high-K solution, a rise of the external Ca concentration to 10 mM, or 5 microM-carbachol, still produced a transient contraction. This suggests that the tonic contraction has disappeared partially because of diminished Ca influx. In glycogen-depleted preparations, the depolarization caused by carbachol, or by 20 mM-K, was increased and spike discharge initiated when glucose was readmitted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,rat aorta; normal rat aorta; diabetic aorta; rats infused with glucose or beta-hydroxybutyrate,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"beta-hydroxybutyrate oxidation, down",Metabolic Regulation,aorta,Vasculature,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"glucose oxidation, down","Fat oxidation, down",14C-beta-hydroxybutyrate; beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

The oxidation of 14C-beta-hydroxybutyrate (0.5 and 1.5 mM) to 14CO2 was impaired in diabetic aorta, while the oxidation of 14C-palmitate (0.5 and 1.0 mM) to 14CO2 was unaltered. The oxidation of both substrates was concentration dependent. The glucose oxidation in normal rat aorta was reduced by addition of 3.0 and 6.0 mM of beta-hydroxybutyrate to the incubation medium, while 1.5 mM palmitate had no effect on the glucose oxidation. After incubation of normal rat aorta in MEM with glucose (20.0 mM) for 46 h the subsequently determined glucose oxidation was not influenced in comparison to the aorta incubated in 5.6 mM glucose. Incubation with 6.0 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate or 1.5 mM palmitate did not affect the aortic glucose oxidation. In rats which were infused for 24 h with glucose or beta-hydroxybutyrate to obtain diabetic levels of these substrates, there was no change in the aortic glucose oxidation compared to saline-infused controls.

Incubation with aminooxyacetate, an inhibitor of aspartate aminotransferase, had no effect on lipid synthesis from glucose, pyruvate or AcAc, but increased lipid synthesis from beta OHB. Results indicate that for lipid synthesis in the neonatal lung, acetyl CoA from AcAc is derived predominantly from a cytoplasmic pathway involving AcAcCoA synthetase and AcAcCoA thiolase, whereas citrate is the major route of acetyl group transfer from glucose.

Age and weight matched, male, Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized under halothane (1-2%), ligated, instrumented, and recovered 2 hrs before hypoxia (4.5% oxygen). Thirty minutes prior to hypoxia, groups of rats received, BD (47 mmoles/kg i.v.; n = 7), equal volumes of saline (S) (n = 6) or no-infusion (NI) (n = 7). Since no significant difference was observed between S and NI they were combined into a single control group (C). In a parallel group administered BD, resultant beta- hydroxybutarate ( BHB ) levels increased from 0.13 +/- 0.02 to 0.84 +/- 0.03 mM and temperature declined only 1.5 degrees C. The EEG of all ischemic-hypoxic rats invariably became isoelectric before cessation of spontaneous respiration and eventual loss of BP. BD significantly (p less than 0.01, Student's t) increased ischemic-hypoxic tolerance (time to isoelectric EEG) from 875 +/- 56 for the control group to 1338 +/- 67 seconds for the BD group, without changing the interval from isoelectric EEG to loss of BP. Further, EEG activity persisted at a lower mean BP (p less than 0.01) in the BD group (44 +/- 5 mm Hg) than in the control group (66 +/- 4 mm Hg). In summary, isoelectric EEG invariably precedes ventilatory failure and cardiovascular collapse.

Using pyruvate (less than 1 mM), lactate, or alanine as the gluconeogenic precursor, infusion of the acetoacetate precursors oleate, acetate, or beta-hydroxybutyrate stimulated the rate of glucose production and, in the case of pyruvate (less than 1 mM), the rate of pyruvate decarboxylation. alpha-Cyanocinnamate, an inhibitor of the monocarboxylate transporter, prevented the stimulation of pyruvate decarboxylation and glucose production due to acetate infusion. With lactate as the gluconeogenic precursor, acetate infusion in the presence of L-carnitine stimulated the rate of gluconeogenesis (100%) and ketogenesis (60%) without altering the tissue acetyl-CoA level usually considered a requisite for the stimulation of gluconeogenesis by fatty acids. Hence, our studies suggest that gluconeogenesis from pyruvate or other substrates which are converted to pyruvate prior to glucose synthesis may be limited or controlled by the rate of entry of pyruvate into the mitochondrial compartment on the monocarboxylate translocator.",0,"mice; fasted mice; alloxan diabetic mice; mice given 1,3-butanediol",animal,Animal – Mouse,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypoxia,General Signs & Symptoms,"hypoxic tolerance, no-change; survival time, up (with glucagon)","Hypoxic tolerance, no-change; Survival, up (with glucagon)",IV and IP beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB),Multi-source,NS

In previous studies fasted mice, alloxan diabetic mice and mice given 1,3-butanediol were found to be ketotic and to have increased tolerance to hypoxia. We attempted to induce a similar increased hypoxic tolerance by direct elevation of blood ketones with IV and IP beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). No increase in hypoxic tolerance was observed with BHB alone. Inasmuch as fasting and alloxan diabetes are both associated with elevated blood glucagon (G), hypoxic tolerance tests were made 30 min after G alone or a combination of G plus BHB. The mice given G alone or BHB alone had hypoxic survival times not different from saline controls.

Animals received DMPGE2, 200 or 300 microgram/kg body weight subcutaneously in 0.5 ml saline, or the saline carrier alone at 0, 12, 24 and 36 hours after administration of streptozotocin. At 40 hours, blood was obtained for measurement of plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) and ketone bodies. DMPGE2 produced a dose-related decrease in plasma FFA levels at 40 hours. FFA levels were 2.76 +/- 0.39 meg/L (mean +/- SEM) with saline, 1.72 +/- 0.22 meg/L with 200 microgram/kg DMPGE2 (p less than 0.05 vs saline) and 1.19 +/- 0.17 meg/L with 300 microgram/kg DMPGE2 (p less than 0.025 vs saline) consistent with the previously demonstrated antilipolytic effect of DMPGE2 in vivo and in vitro. Despite suppression of lipolysis, DMPGE2 enhanced the development of ketosis during the genesis of DKA. The beta-hydroxybutyrate level was 5.89 +/- 0.06 mM with saline, 8.15 +/- 1.02 mM with 200 microgram/kg DMPGE2 and 11.17 +/- 0.60 mM with 300 microgram/kg DMPGE2 (p less than 0.001 vs saline). This study demonstrates that this analog of prostaglandin E2 promotes the development of ketosis during the genesis of DKA despite decreased substrate availability.

While glucose is known to cross the placenta, there is limited information regarding the placental transfer of ketones and their associated cardiovascular and metabolic effects in the fetus. Thus, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the transfer of the ketoacid beta hydroxybutyrate across the ovine placenta and to determine the effects of this ketoacid on maternal and fetal physiologic and metabolic parameters. Pregnant ewes (110 to 120 days' gestation) were instrumented with catheters in the lateral branch of both uterine arteries, uterine veins, femoral artery, and femoral vein, and electromagnetic flow probes were placed on both middle uterine arteries. Catheters were placed in the fetal carotid artery and jugular vein, and a catheter and balloon were placed in the amniotic fluid. Beta hydroxybutyrate (0.39 mmole/100 ml of uterine blood flow) and antipyrine (00.27 mmole/100 ml of uterine blood flow) as a second reference marker, were infused simultaneously into the uterine arteries for a period of 2 hours. The beta hydroxybutyrate concentrations in the uterine vein increased to 5.93 +/- 1.32 mmoles/L, and were associated with a significant increase in maternal heart rate and a slight but significant reduction in uterine blood flow. No changes in maternal arterial blood gas values were noted. The concentration of beta hydroxybutyrate in the fetal carotid arteries increased from 0.01 +/- 0.01 mmole/l to 0.15 +/- 0.03 mmole/L, and were associated with a significant reduction in fetal PaO2 (24.2 +/- 0.9 to 17.9 +/- 1.9 mm Hg) and an elevation of fetal lactate levels (1.86 +/- 0.17 to 5.07 +/- 1.56 mmoles/L).",0,rat fetal brain slices,animal; in vitro,Multi-model,"restraining irreversible decarboxylation, down",Other / Unspecified,fetal brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Maternal starvation,Reproductive & Pregnancy,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
6846575,Fetal fuels VI. Metabolism of alpha-ketoisocaproic acid in fetal rat brain.,"The metabolic regulation of alpha-ketoisocaproic acid was studied in fetal brain from rats. Starvation of the mother for days 18-20 did not alter CO2 evolution from alpha-ketoisocaproic acid in fetal brain slices but significantly diminished the incorporation of the branched-chain keto acids into leucine. When fetal brain slices from starved mothers were exposed to graded concentrations of labeled alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (0.05-2.5 mM), over 70% of the labeled products were consistently represented by leucine and less than 30% by CO2. Both beta-hydroxybutyrate and pyruvate, alone and in combination, diminished the amount of 14CO2 that evolved from alpha-ketoisocaproic acid-1-14C, but had no effect on the conversion of the keto acid to labeled leucine. It is concluded that exogenous alpha-ketoisocaproic acid is preferentially converted to leucine by fetal brain slices independent of the nutritional state of the mother. During maternal starvation, beta-hydroxybutyrate, by restraining irreversible decarboxylation of alpha-ketoisocaproic acid, could act to salvage the keto acid for conversion to leucine. Thus alpha-ketoisocaproic acid metabolism in the fetal brain may be regulated in part by altered metabolic functions in this structure and in part by changing components in circulating fuel mixtures reaching the fetus from the starved mother.",0,sheep; fed sheep; fasted sheep; fasted-infected sheep,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"ketonemia, up",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Sepsis,Infectious,"glucose production, no-change","Blood glucose, no-change","sodium-DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB, 20 mumol X kg-1 X min-1)",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

To determine if the ketonemia following sepsis contributed to the increased glucogenesis associated with catabolic disorder, glucose production and arterial substrates were measured before and after infusion of sodium-DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB, 20 mumol X kg-1 X min-1) in fed, fasted, and fasted-infected animals. Following 3 h of beta-OHB infusion in the awake conditioned animals, beta-OHB and acetoacetate blood concentrations more than doubled.

Rates of protein degradation greatly exceeded protein synthesis in Langendorff preparations supplied glucose. This severely negative nitrogen balance was brought closer to zero by provision of more complete substrate mixtures. Cardiac work further improved the nitrogen balance by stimulating protein synthesis in hearts supplied glucose (mixture 1), glucose-insulin-glucagon-lactate-beta-hydroxybutyrate (mixture 2), or palmitate-beta-hydroxybutyrate-glucose (mixture 3) and inhibiting protein degradation in hearts supplied glucose. Cardiac work did not affect the rates of either protein synthesis or degradation in hearts provided insulin-lactate-glucose (mixture 4). The increase in protein synthesis was associated with increased rates of peptide chain initiation.

Effects of various fuels on in vitro ammoniagenesis.,"The addition of many oxidizable substrates to the medium of incubating rat renal slices decreases ammoniagenesis from glutamine and glutamate. Interestingly, lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate depress ammoniagenesis less in renal slices from acidotic rats compared with normal-control rats. In this study, the effects of an expanded panel of substrates on ammoniagenesis in kidney slices from control and acidotic rats were followed to discern patterns of inhibition. In addition to lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetate, pyruvate, and perhaps acetoacetate caused relatively less depression of ammoniagenesis in acidotic slices. Citrate, succinate, fumarate, octanoate, and alpha-ketoglutarate decreased ammoniagenesis to the same extent or more in acidotic slices compared with that in normal-control slices. Glycerol had little effect on ammoniagenesis under either condition. From the substrates tested, it can be generalized that those outside the TCA cycle (with exception of octanoate) depress ammoniagenesis less during acidosis, while those in the TCA cycle depress ammoniagenesis equally or even more during acidosis. We hypothesize from the pattern of our results that changes in renal intermediary metabolism at or before citrate formation occur during acidosis and are important regulatory mechanisms for ammoniagenesis.",INS; 0,healthy nonobese; obese; insulin-dependent diabetics; obese after 3 days starvation; obese after 3-10 wks starvation; subjects fasted 5-10 wks,human,NS; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"proteolysis, down",Cell Death & Survival,muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Starvation,Metabolic & Endocrine,"urinary nitrogen, down; muscle alanine release, down","Urinary nitrogen, down; Muscle metabolism, down",infused; endogenous ketonemia from isocaloric carbohydrate restriction,NS; Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
7005257,The effect of ketone bodies and dietary carbohydrate intake on protein metabolism.,"To evaluate the effect ketone bodies on protein metabolism beta-hydroxybutyrate was infused into healthy nonobese and obese subjects and insulin dependent diabetics in the postabsorptive state and into obese subjects after 3 days and 3-10 wks of starvation. In association with blood ketone increments of 1-2 mM, plasma alanine fell by 25-35% in all treatment groups. Furthermore, the hypoalaninemic effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate was equally demonstrable in fasted subjects, in whom alanine was already reduced. In association with repeated 12 hr infusions of beta-hydroxybutyrate in subjects fasted 5-10 wks, urinary nitrogen fell by 30%, returning to baseline after cessation of the infusions and paralleling the changes in plasma alanine. When endogenous ketonemia was produced by isocaloric carbohydrate restriction (less than 25 gm/day), protein ingestion was associated with a 40-50% greater increase in plasma branched chain amino acids as well as a reduced rise in plasma insulin. The enhanced rise in branched chain amino acids was attributable to decreased net utilization since intravenous leucine also produced a 40% greater elevation in plasma leucine after carbohydrate restriction. When nitrogen balance was compared during hypocaloric (400 Kcal) feeding of a pure protein diet and a mixed diet containing 50% protein and 50% carbohydrate, no significant differences were observed. Isocaloric replacement with carbohydrate failed to accentuate nitrogen wasting, despite a marked lowering of blood and urinary ketones. Our findings support the possibility that ketone bodies contribute to the reduction in proteolysis and decrease in muscle alanine release which characterizes prolonged starvation. However, when endogenous hyperketonemia is induced by carbohydrate restriction, plasma insulin declines and the disposal of ingested protein is impaired. Furthermore, the addition of carbohydrate during hypocaloric feeding reduces hyperketonemia, but does not enhance negative nitrogen balance. These observations suggest that dietary carbohydrate and insulin also promote nitrogen retention and that ketogenic, high protein diets do not confer a unique protein sparing advantage.",INS; GCG,seven normal postabsorptive volunteers,human,Human – Interventional,"glucose production suppression, down",Metabolic Regulation,hepatic,Liver,pancreatic B cell,Pancreatic Endocrine,β-cells (islet),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"plasma glucose, down","Blood glucose, down",infused for 3 h,NS,NS
7013504,Suppression of glucose production and stimulation of insulin secretion by physiological concentrations of ketone bodies in man.,"To determine the mechanism by which ketone bodies decrease plasma glucose in man, seven normal postabsorptive volunteers were infused for 3 h with beta-hydroxybutyrate. Total plasma ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate plus acetoacetate) increased to levels (approximately 2.5 mM) observed after a 2- to 3-day fast in normal subjects. Plasma glucose decreased 10% concomitant with decreases of 25% and 10%, respectively, in the rates of glucose production and glucose utilization determined isotopically with [3-3H]glucose. Plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations were unaltered, but plasma C-peptide levels increased from 2.6 +/- 0.1 ng/ml to a maximum of 3.9 +/- 0.2 ng/ml at 30 min (P < 0.01) and remained significantly increased for more than 2 h. Plasma alanine decreased approximately 14% (P < 0.05), while plasma lactate increased 25% (P < 0.01) so that there was no net decrease in the combined levels of these gluconeogenic substrates. These results demonstrate that physiological increments in circulating ketone body concentrations decrease plasma glucose in normal man by suppressing glucose production, an effect which can be explained by the stimulation of insulin secretion being reflected only in changes in plasma C-peptide. Thus, changes in pancreatic B cell function not sufficient to alter peripheral plasma insulin levels may cause significant changes in hepatic glucose production.",0,isolated perfused rat heart; fasted rat hearts; diabetic rat hearts,animal,Animal – Rat,"pantothenate kinase activity, down",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",10 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate in the perfusate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Incorporation of [14C]pantothenic acid ([14C]PA) into CoA was determined to estimate rates of CoA synthesis. Although CoA levels were elevated in hearts removed from fasted and diabetic animals, in vitro rates of CoA synthesis were not elevated. The presence of 1.2 mM palmitate, 5 mM pyruvate, or 10 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate in the perfusate-reduced PA incorporation into CoA in control hearts by 40, 60, and 80%, respectively. Insulin (25 mU/ml) reduced incorporation by 90%. The alterations in CoA synthesis in hearts perfused with buffer containing palmitate, pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and insulin were associated with no change in myocardial PA uptake. Data indicate that these substrates and insulin inhibit the first step in the pathway of CoA synthesis, pantothenate kinase.

The effects of (-)-hydroxycitrate, an inhibitor of ATP-citrate lyase; methylmalonate, an inhibitor of beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase; and increasing concentrations of unlabeled acetoacetate were examined. The incorporation of label into lactate, citrate, malate, and acetylcholine (ACh) was measured and 3H:14C ratios calculated. Incorporation of [14C]beta-hydroxybutyrate into lactate was limited because of the low activity of gluconeogenic enzymes in brain, whereas incorporation of 14C label into Krebs cycle intermediates and ACh was higher than in previous experiments with [3H-,14C]-glucose. (-)-Hydroxycitrate (5.0 mM) reduced incorporation of [3H]glucose and [14C]beta-hydroxybutyrate into ACh. In contrast, slices incubated with methylmalonate (1 mM) showed a decrease in 14C incorporation without appreciably affecting glucose metabolism. The effects of high concentrations of methylmalonate were nonselective and yielded a generalized decrease in metabolism. Acetoacetate (1 mM) also produced a decreased 14C incorporation into ACh and its precursors. At 10 mM, acetoacetate reduced 3H and 14C incorporation into ACh without substantially affecting total ACh content. From the results, it is suggested that in adult rats beta-hydroxybutyrate can contribute to the acetyl moiety of ACh, possibly via the citrate cleavage pathway, though it is quantitatively less important than glucose and pyruvate. This contribution of ketone bodies could become significant should their concentration become abnormally high or glucose metabolism be reduced.",PDHA1; MPC1,fed rats; perfused livers,animal,Animal – Rat; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"pyruvate transport into mitochondria, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
7107640,Role of pyruvate transporter in the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex in perfused rat liver.,"Metabolic substrates such as octanoate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and alpha-ketoisocaproate which produce acetoacetate stimulate the rate of pyruvate decarboxylation in perfused livers from fed rats at perfusate pyruvate concentrations in the physiological range (below 0.2 mM). A quantitative relationship between pyruvate oxidation (14CO2 production from [1-14C]pyruvate) and ketogenesis (production of acetoacetate or total ketone bodies) was observed with all ketogenic substrates when studied over a wide range of concentrations. The ratio of extra pyruvate decarboxylated to extra acetoacetate produced was greater than 1 with octanoate and alpha-ketoisocaproate, but it was less than 1 with beta-hydroxybutyrate. The stimulatory effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate on pyruvate decarboxylation was abolished completely in the presence of 0.1 mM alpha-cyanocinnamate, an inhibitor of the pyruvate transporting system in the mitochondrial membrane. The data suggest that the mechanism by which the flux through the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction is stimulated in liver under ketogenic conditions involves an acceleration of the net rate of pyruvate transport into the mitochondria compartment due to an exchange with acetoacetate and/or acetoacetate plus beta-hydroxybutyrate.",PANK1,isolated perfused rat hearts,animal,Animal – Rat,"pantothenate kinase activity, down",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondrial compartment,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",in the perfusate of isolated hearts,In vitro media supplementation,NS

Pantothenic acid (PA), coenzyme A, and intermediates in the the pathway were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography. The amount of 14C label in each of the metabolites was determined in tissue extracts when [14C]PA was supplied in the perfusate. The rate-controlling steps in the pathway were determined by measuring the net rate of [14C]PA flux through each of the reactions. The data indicated that the primary site of control in the pathway was the pantothenate kinase-catalyzed reaction, the first intracellular step in the conversion of PA to CoA. The rate of this reaction was inhibited by including glucose, pyruvate, fatty acids, or beta-hydroxybutyrate in the perfusate of isolated hearts. Pyruvate and beta-hydroxybutyrate caused a much greater inhibition than did glucose. Insulin was a strong inhibitor, but only in the presence of glucose. Insulin had no effect in hearts receiving either no substrate or palmitate as substrate. Collectively, these data indicated that an unknown tissue metabolite whose level changed with each of these substrates and insulin is a strong regulator of pantothenate kinase. Synthesis of CoA occurred in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments. Accelerated mitochondrial CoA synthesis appeared to be dependent upon the production and accumulation of 4'-phosphopantotheine, which occurred only when pantothenate kinase was stimulated.",GLUD1,isolated perfused kidneys from normal rats; isolated perfused kidneys from acidotic rats; isolated renal mitochondria,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio reduction, down",Multiple mechanisms,kidney,Kidney,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Acidosis,Metabolic & Endocrine,"ammoniagenesis, no-change","Ammoniagenesis, no-change",NS,NS,NS

Glutamine synthesis was not affected by beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Measurement of metabolite levels in freeze-clamped kidneys showed that BHB increased glutamine concentration, decreased ammonia concentration, and reduced the mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio (calculated) in perfused kidneys. BHB inhibited flux through the glutamate dehydrogenase pathway, probably as a result of reduction in the NAD+/NADH ratio, in isolated renal mitochondria. In isolated perfused kidneys from acidotic rats, ammonia production and mitochondrial NAD+/NADH were both elevated and BHB did not inhibit renal ammoniagenesis. Although ammonia production in the acidotic kidneys was not directly related to the mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio, the elevation of this ratio may have permitted a normal rate of oxidation of glutamine end products--which is essential for maintaining the elevated ammoniagenesis--to take place in the presence of BHB.",0,pregnant ewes (110 to 120 days' gestation),animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"fetal PaO2, down",Ion & Nutrient Transport,placenta,Placenta/Decidua,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Multi-disease,"perinatal mortality, up","Mortality, up",infused directly into the fetal jugular vein (0.44 mmole/min),Intravenous BHB,NS

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the metabolic alterations in diabetic vascular tissue influence energy production. Aortas of normal and diabetic male Sprague-Dawley rats were incubated in vitro for up to 120 min with various substrates added to the incubation medium. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin and the rats were used after a diabetes duration of two weeks. When normal and diabetic aorta were incubated in the presence of 5.6 mmol/l glucose no significant difference in ATP-concentration was found after 60 min while after 120 min the ATP-concentration was lowered in diabetic aorta. Addition to the incubation medium of a substrate mixture containing amino acids in the same concentrations as in rat plasma, 3 mmol/l DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate and 1.5 mmol/l palmitate increased the ATP-concentration, measured after 120 min, in diabetic aorta but not in normal aorta. No significant difference in ATP-concentration was found between normal and diabetic aorta incubated in a medium containing all substrates. When diabetic aorta was incubated with each substrate separately beta-hydroxybutyrate but not glucose, palmitate or amino acids, increased the ATP-concentration to about the same level as the complete substrate mixture.

The rate of decarboxylation of alpha-keto[1-14C]isocaproate exceeded that of alpha-keto[1-14C]isovalerate at all concentrations of the substrates infused. Coinfusion of either alpha-ketoisovalerate or alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate inhibited the rate of alpha-keto[1-14C]isocaproate decarboxylation. The rate of alpha-keto[1-14C]isovalerate decarboxylation ws enhanced during coinfusion of L(--)carnitine, while alpha-keto[1-14C]isocaproate decarboxylation was unaffected. The presence of pyruvate in the perfusion medium resulted in an inhibition of the flux through the branched chain complex with either alpha-ketoisocaproate or alpha-ketoisovalerate as the substrate. DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion inhibited alpha-keto[1-14C]isocaproate decarboxylation by 18% but resulted in nearly a 100% stimulation of alpha-keto[1-14C]isovalerate decarboxylation. The evidence presented indicates that (alpha) the metabolic flux through the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex can be monitored effectively in a continuous fashion in the perfused liver by following the release of 14CO2 from infused 1-14C-labeled substrates and (b) the changes observed in the metabolic flux through the branched chain complex during coinfusion of alternative substrates and other compounds may be entirely different depending upon which branched chain alpha-keto acid substrate is utilized to monitor this reaction.",0,fetal rat brains at 20 days gestation; fetal brain slices; mothers starved from days 18-20,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice; Animal – Other Mammal,"critical dehydrogenase step, down",Metabolic Regulation,fetal brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
7301731,Fetal fuels. IV. Regulation of branched-chain amino and keto acid metabolism in fetal brain.,"The regulation of branched-chain amino and keto acid metabolism was examined in fetal rat brains at 20 days gestation. When fetal brain slices were incubated with [1-14C]leucine, graded concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate resulted in a progressive rise in labeled alpha-ketoisocaproic acid accompanied by a fall in 14CO2, whereas the sum of these products remained unchanged. These reciprocal relationships were maintained when leucine concentrations were varied from 0.4 to 4 mM. Increasing concentrations of glucose or pyruvate enhanced the formation of both 14CO2 and alpha-ketoisocaproic acid from [1-14C]leucine, but resulted in a progressive decrease in the conversion of alpha-ketoisocaproic acid to 14CO2. That glucose and ketone bodies probably acted via separate mechanisms was suggested by a further inhibition of alpha-ketoisocaproic acid decarboxylation whenever beta-hydroxybutyrate was added. When mothers were starved from days 18-20, a threefold rise in circulating branched-chain keto acids was reflected concordantly in the fetus and was attended by a significant enhancement of leucine transaminase activity in fetal brain. Because levels of circulating ketone bodies reported during maternal starvation were maximally effective in diminishing the conversion of alpha-ketoisocaproic acid to 14CO4, it is suggested that the inhibitory effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate on the critical dehydrogenase step in branched-chain keto acid metabolism in fetal brain could restrain oxidation of maternally derived alpha-ketoisocaproic acid, thereby permitting salvage for reversible transamination to leucine.",0,isolated chicken hepatocytes,animal; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"reducing equivalents, up",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,hepatocytes,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Glucogenesis was significantly affected by a change in the oxidation-reduction (pyruvate/lactate) ratio, and this effect was greater than could be accounted for by the additive effects of these substrates. Substituting lactate with nongluconeogenic substrates, such as beta-hydroxybutyrate or ethanol, increased the formation of glucose by 80 and 200%, respectively, demonstrating the beneficial effect of the increased reducing equivalents in the hepatocytes.

Lowering free calcium concentration by means of EGTA leads to a reduction of maximum transport capacity to less than 25% of the total added calcium. Under these conditions addition of oxaloacetate inhibits calcium uptake, an effect which is blocked by equimolar concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Oxaloacetate and acetoacetate induce an efflux of previously accumulated mitochondrial calcium. These effects appear to be independent of free calcium concentration and of whether the mitochondria were obtained from fed rats or rats fasted for 16 h or 4 days.",0,starved rats; kidney cortex tubules,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"sparing of fatty acid oxidation, down",Metabolic Regulation,kidney cortex,Kidney,proximal tubules,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate (5mm),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic
7435617,Triacylglycerol metabolism in isolated rat kidney cortex tubules.,"Triacylglycerol metabolism has been studied in kidney cortex tubules from starved rats, prepared by collagenase treatment. Triacylglycerol was determined by a newly developed fully enzymic method. Incubation of tubules in the absence of fatty acids led to a decrease of endogenous triacylglycerol by about 50% in 1h. Addition of albuminbound oleate or palmitate resulted in a steady increase of tissue triacylglycerol over 2h. The rate of triacylglycerol synthesis was linearly dependent on oleate concentration up to 0.8mm, reaching a saturation at higher concentrations. Triacylglycerol formation from palmitate was less than that from oleate. This difference was qualitatively the same when net synthesis was compared with incorporation of labelled fatty acids. Quantitatively, however, the difference was less with the incorporation technique. Gluconeogenic substrates, which by themselves had no effect on triacylglycerol concentrations, stimulated neutral lipid formation from fatty acids. Glucose and lysine did not have such a stimulatory effect. Inhibition of gluconeogenesis from lactate by mercaptopicolinic acid likewise inhibited triacylglycerol formation. This inhibitory effect was seen with oleate as well as with oleate plus lactate. When [2-(14)C]lactate was used the incorporation of label into triacylglycerol was found in the glycerol moiety exclusively. Addition of dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate (5mm) to the incubation medium in the presence of oleate or oleate plus lactate led to a significant increase in triacylglycerol formation. In contrast with the gluconeogenic substrates, dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate had no stimulatory effect on fatty acid uptake. The results suggest that renal triacylglycerol formation is a quantitatively important metabolic process. The finding that gluconeogenic substrates, but not glucose, increase lipid formation, indicates that the glycerol moiety is formed by glyceroneogenesis in the proximal tubules. The effect of ketone bodies seems to be caused by the sparing action of these substrates on fatty acid oxidation. The decrease of triacylglycerol in the absence of exogenous substrates confirms previous conclusions that endogenous lipids provide fatty acids for renal energy metabolism.",0,acidotic dogs (NH4Cl),animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"alpha-ketoglutarate generation, up",Metabolic Regulation,renal cortex,Kidney,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Acidosis,Metabolic & Endocrine,"renal ammoniagenesis, down","Kidney function, down",infused with beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
7488648,Cellular mechanisms of the antiammoniagenic effect of ketone bodies in the dog.,"To investigate the mechanisms of the antiammoniagenic effect of ketone bodies, acidotic dogs (NH4Cl) were infused with either beta-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate. Total blood ketones ranged from 2 to 4 mM. Renal ammoniagenesis fell by a mean of 53%, with a proportional decrease in glutamine extraction. Glutamate release in the renal vein rose, renal extraction of lactate fell, and aspartate and alanine production decreased. Study of the metabolite profile of the renal cortex by the freeze-clamp technique before and after ketone infusion showed that tissue glutamine concentration was unchanged, whereas glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, malate, and citrate rose. The intermediates of the gluconeogenic pathway, such as phosphoenolypyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, and glucose-6-phosphate, fell significantly. The redox state as calculated from the free NAD+/NADH ratios in the cytosolic (lactate dehydrogenase) and the mitochondrial (glutamate dehydrogenase and beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase) compartments was reduced. The present study suggests that ketone bodies inhibit renal ammoniagenesis through increased generation of alpha-ketoglutarate (metabolic or bicarbonate effect) and a decrease in the mitochondrial and cytosolic redox potentials in the kidney.",0,isolated hepatocytes; GSH-depleted hepatocytes,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"NADH generation, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,liver,Liver,hepatocyte,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypoxic liver injury,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"cytotoxicity, up","Cell viability, up",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
7586049,Modulating hypoxia-induced hepatocyte injury by affecting intracellular redox state.,"Hypoxia-induced hepatocyte injury results not only from ATP depletion but also from reductive stress and oxygen activation. Thus the NADH/NAD+ ratio was markedly increased in isolated hepatocytes maintained under 95% N2/5% CO2 in Krebs-Henseleit buffer well before plasma membrane disruption occurred. Glycolytic nutrients fructose, dihydroxyacetone or glyceraldehyde prevented cytotoxicity, restored the NADH/NAD+ ratio, and prevented complete ATP depletion. However, the NADH generating nutrients sorbitol, xylitol, glycerol and beta-hydroxybutyrate enhanced hypoxic cytotoxicity even though ATP depletion was not affected. On the other hand, NADH oxidising metabolic intermediates oxaloacetate or acetoacetate prevented hypoxic cytotoxicity but did not affect ATP depletion. Restoring the cellular NADH/NAD+ ratio with the artificial electron acceptors dichlorophenolindophenol and Methylene blue also prevented hypoxic injury and partly restored ATP levels. Ethanol which further increased the cellular NADH/NAD+ ratio increased by hypoxia also markedly increased toxicity whereas acetaldehyde which restored the normal cellular NADH/NAD+ ratio, prevented toxicity even though hypoxia induced ATP depletion was little affected by ethanol or acetaldehyde. The viability of hypoxic hepatocytes is therefore more dependent on the maintenance of normal redox homeostasis than ATP levels. GSH may buffer these redox changes as hypoxia caused cell injury much sooner with GSH depleted hepatocytes. Hypoxia also caused an intracellular release of free iron and cytotoxicity was prevented by desferoxamine. Furthermore, increasing the cellular NADH/NAD+ ratio markedly increased the intracellular release of iron. Hypoxia-induced hepatocyte injury was also prevented by oxypurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. Polyphenolic antioxidants or the superoxide dismutase mimic, TEMPO partly prevented cytotoxicity suggesting that reactive oxygen species contributed to the cytotoxicity. The above results suggests that hypoxia induced hepatocyte injury results from sustained reductive stress and oxygen activation.",0,hepatocytes,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"NADH/NAD+ ratio, up",Multiple mechanisms,liver,Liver,hepatocytes,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cytotoxicity, up","Cell viability, up",NS,NS,NS
7710141,Hepatocyte injury resulting from the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration at low oxygen concentrations involves reductive stress and oxygen activation.,"By correlating lactate/pyruvate ratios and ATP levels, cytotoxicity induced by the mitochondrial respiratory inhibitors or hypoxia:reoxygenation injury can be attributed not only to ATP depletion but also to reductive stress and oxygen activation. Thus hypoxia, cyanide or antimycin markedly increases reductive stress, non-heme Fe release and H2O2 formation in hepatocytes. Cytotoxicity was partly prevented with the ferric chelator desferoxamine, the xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol and the hydrogen peroxide scavenger glutathione. No lipid peroxidation could be detected and phenolic anti-oxidants had little effect. However, polyphenolic antioxidants or the superoxide dismutase mimics TEMPO or TEMPOL partly prevented cytotoxicity. Furthermore, increasing the hepatocyte NADH/NAD+ ratio with NADH generating compounds such as ethanol, glycerol, or beta-hydroxybutyrate markedly increased cytotoxicity (prevented by desferoxamine) and further increased the intracellular release of non-heme iron. Cytotoxicity could be prevented by glycolytic substrates (eg. fructose, dihydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde) or the NADH utilising substrates acetoacetate or acetaldehyde which decreased the reductive stress and prevented intracellular iron release. These results suggest that liver injury resulting from insufficient respiration involves reductive stress which releases intracellular Fe, converts xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase and causes mitochondrial oxygen activation. The cell's antioxidant defences are compromised and ATP catabolism contributes to oxygen activation.",0,streptozotocin-diabetic rats; day-9 rat embryos in whole-embryo culture,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"mitochondrial swelling, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,neuroepithelium,NS,neuroepithelial cells,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Diabetic pregnancy,Reproductive & Pregnancy,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
7714106,Altered mitochondrial morphology of rat embryos in diabetic pregnancy.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies in vivo and in vitro have suggested that the oxidative metabolism of the embryo may have a role in the teratogenicity of diabetic pregnancy. In particular, the production of reactive oxygen species by the embryonic mitochondria has been implicated in the teratological process. The induction of congenital malformations by the diabetic milieu occurs during the early embryonic development. The present study aimed to estimate the role of the embryonic mitochondria in the teratological process of diabetic pregnancy by studying mitochondrial morphology in the embryos exposed to a diabetic environment in vivo or in vitro during early organogenesis and late fetal development. METHODS: For studies in vivo embryos of control or streptozotocin-diabetic rats were taken at gestational days 9-11 and subjected to light and electron microscopical analysis. The brain, heart, and liver of day-15 fetuses were also observed. For studies in vitro day-9 embryos of normal rats were cultured in a whole-embryo culture system for 48 hours. The culture media were supplied with high concentration of diabetes-related substrates and metabolites, and their effect on structure of embryonic neuroepithelial cells determined. RESULTS: The light microscopical observations demonstrated numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles in the ectoderm of day-9 embryos and in the neuroepithelium and blood cells of day-10 and day-11 embryos of diabetic rats. Ultrastructurally, these vacuoles were found to be mitochondria undergoing large-amplitude swelling with loss of matrix density and disturbed cristae. In contrast, no mitochondrial differences were found in the brain, heart, and liver, when day-15 fetuses from normal and diabetic rats were compared. Ultrastructural analysis of day-9 embryos cultured for 48 hours in the presence of high concentrations of D-glucose, pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and alpha-ketoisocaproate also showed high-amplitude mitochondrial swelling in the neuroepithelium. The mitochondrial swelling was, however, not found in embryos cultured in a high concentration of L-glucose, excluding simple osmotic effects of the diabetes-related substrates and metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: The mitochondrial morphological changes appeared in embryos subjected to a diabetic environment during a time period when the congenital malformations in diabetic pregnancy are induced. The results support the notion that embryonic mitochondria are involved in the teratological process of diabetic pregnancy.",0,19-yr-old patient with homozygous mutation of the insulin receptor alpha-subunit,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"IGF-I receptor activation, down",Hormonal Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Insulin receptor alpha-subunit mutation,Genetic / Congenital,"beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, down","Blood ketones (BHB), down",NS,NS,NS
7729031,In vivo metabolic effects of insulin-like growth factor-I not mediated through the insulin receptor.,"Patients with mutations affecting insulin receptor function may maintain some degree of metabolic control. The hypothesis has been put forth that in these patients, fuels may be metabolized through pathways (i.e. receptor activation) that become relevant in such abnormal conditions. The aim of our study was to evaluate the metabolic effects of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in a 19-yr-old patient with homozygous mutation of the insulin receptor alpha-subunit. Her metabolic and hormonal features were marked hyperglycemia (11-33 mmol/L) and hyperinsulinemia (1000-2000 pmol/L); normal free fatty acids and lactate; low IGF-I; glycerol, alanine, and pyruvate below the normal range; and elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate. Unlike diabetic ketoacidosis, no triglyceride or protein breakdown was present, suggesting a compensatory mechanism, possibly sustained by the insulin concentration acting on IGF-I receptors. Subcutaneous administration of IGF-I (40, 80, and 120 micrograms/kg), although not affecting plasma glucose, resulted in a rapid decrease in free fatty acids and prevented the rise of beta-hydroxybutyrate levels compared to placebo. Therefore, IGF-I can exert direct metabolic effects in vivo, probably through activation of its own receptor, even at a concentration not affecting blood glucose levels. Furthermore, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that IGF-I receptors may be activated by high insulin levels, providing lipid and protein regulation in patients with nonfunctional insulin receptors.",0,isolated working rat hearts,animal,Animal – Rat,"competing substrate, down",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan","D,L-beta-hydroxybutyrate (40 mmol/L)",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic
7731048,Fundamental limitations of [18F]2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose for assessing myocardial glucose uptake.,"BACKGROUND: The glucose tracer analog [18F]2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) is widely used for assessing regional myocardial glucose metabolism in vivo. The reproducibility of this method has recently been questioned because of a discordant affinity of hexokinase for its substrates glucose and 2-deoxyglucose. We therefore compared rates of glucose utilization simultaneously with tissue time-activity curves of FDG uptake before and after changes in the physiological environment of the heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated working rat hearts were perfused for 60 minutes with recirculating Krebs buffer containing glucose (10 mmol/L), FDG (1 microCi/mL), [2-3H]glucose (0.05 microCi/mL), and [U-14C]2-deoxyglucose (2-DG; 0.025 microCi/mL). Myocardial glucose uptake was measured by tracer ([2-3H]glucose) and tracer analog methods (FDG and 2-DG) before and after the addition of either insulin (1 mU/mL), epinephrine (1 mumol/L), lactate (40 mmol/L), or D,L-beta-hydroxybutyrate (40 mmol/L) at 30 minutes of perfusion and after acute changes in cardiac workload. Under steady-state conditions, myocardial rates of glucose utilization as measured by tritiated water (3H2O) production from metabolism of [2-3H]glucose, FDG uptake, and 2-DG retention were linearly related. The addition of competing substrates decreased glucose utilization immediately. The addition of insulin increased the rate of glucose utilization as measured by the glucose tracer but not as measured by the tracer analogs. The ratio of 3H2O release/myocardial FDG uptake increased by 111% after the addition of insulin, by 428% after the addition of lactate, and by 232% after the addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Epinephrine increased rates of glucose utilization and contractile performance, whereas there was no increase in glucose uptake with a comparable increase in workload alone. There was no change in the relation between the glucose tracer and the tracer analog either with epinephrine or with acute changes in workload. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake and retention of FDG in heart muscle is linearly related to glucose utilization only under steady-state conditions. Addition of insulin or of competing substrates changes the relation between uptake of the glucose tracer and FDG. These observations preclude the determination of absolute rates of myocardial glucose uptake by the tracer analog method under non-steady-state conditions.",0,working perfused rabbit hearts,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"mitochondrial NADH, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cardiac output and dP/dt, down","Cardiac output, down",0.5-1.0 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
7745004,The relationship between phosphorylation potential and redox state in the isolated working rabbit heart.,"The effects of the cytosolic and mitochondrial redox state on the function and phosphorylation potential of working perfused rabbit hearts were studied. Hearts were perfused with glucose, while lactate, aminooxy-acetate (an inhibitor of the malate-aspartate shuttle), beta-hydroxybutyrate, and pyruvate were sequentially added to the perfusate to manipulate the cytosolic and mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio. The phosphorylation potential and product of ADP and P(i) were both found to be proportional to mitochondrial redox state. There was no overall relationship between cytosolic redox potential and the ATP/ADP x P(i) ratio, although at high mitochondrial NADH, there was a tendency for the states with more reduced cytoplasm to be associated with a lower phosphorylation potential. Cardiac output and dP/dt were decreased after 75 microM aminooxy-acetate was present for 15 min, and remained low when 0.5-1.0 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate was added, even though the beta-hydroxybutyrate period was characterized by both very low cytosolic NAD+/NADH and high mitochondrial NADH. Function returned to normal when the cytoplasm was oxidized by addition of 10 mM pyruvate, and although MVO2 rose from 4.0 +/- 0.4 to 5.0 +/- 0.5, this was not accompanied by statistical changes in either mitochondrial NADH or phosphorylation potential. Therefore, the cytosolic redox state may play a role in cardiac function, but has only a minor contribution to the regulation of the phosphorylation potential in the working perfused rabbit heart.",INS; PDHA1; 0,human islets,human; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"glucose-fatty acid cycle, down",Metabolic Regulation,human islets,Pancreas,B-cell,Hematopoietic / Immune,B cells,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Type 1 diabetes mellitus; Type 2 diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"B-cell responsiveness, down","Immune response, down",beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-D-OHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB
7817789,Long term exposure to fatty acids and ketones inhibits B-cell functions in human pancreatic islets of Langerhans.,"We previously demonstrated in the rat that long term exposure to fatty acids inhibits B-cell function in vivo and in vitro. To further assess the clinical significance of these findings, we tested in human islets the effects of fatty acids on glucose-induced insulin release and biosynthesis and on pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. Human islets were obtained from the beta-Cell Transplant Unit (Brussels, Belgium). Exposure to 0.125 mmol/L palmitate or oleate for 48 h during tissue culture (RPMI-1640 and 5.5 mmol/L glucose) inhibited the postculture insulin response to 27 mmol/L glucose by 40% and 42% (P < 0.01 for difference). Inhibition was partly prevented by coculture with 1 mumol/L etomoxir, a carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase-I inhibitor (P < 0.05 for effect of etomoxir). Inhibitory effects on glucose-induced insulin secretion by previous palmitate were additive to the inhibitory effects exerted by previous high glucose (11 and 27 mmol/L). Palmitate-induced inhibition of insulin secretion was evident after exposure to 25 mumol/L added fatty acid. The insulin content of islets exposed to fatty acids was significantly reduced, and glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis was inhibited by 59% after palmitate addition and by 51% after oleate exposure (P < 0.01). These effects were partly prevented by etomoxir (P < 0.05). The activity of PDH in mitochondrial extracts of islets preexposed for 48 h to palmitate was decreased by 35% (P < 0.05) vs. that in control islets, whereas the activity of PDH kinase (which inactivates PDH) was significantly increased in the same preparations (P < 0.05). The effects of ketones were tested by 48-h exposure to beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-D-OHB). Ten millimoles of D-beta-OHB per L inhibited the subsequently tested insulin response to 27 mmol/L glucose by 56% (P < 0.001). Half-maximal inhibitory effects of D-beta-OHB on insulin secretion and insulin content were seen at concentrations between 0.5-2.5 mmol/L. Inhibition by D-beta-OHB was partially reversed by etomoxir, whereas exposure to D-beta-OHB failed to affect PDH and PDH kinase activities. We conclude that fatty acids as well as ketone bodies diminish B-cell responsiveness to glucose in human islets by way of a glucose-fatty acid cycle. Increased plasma concentrations of fatty acids and ketones are likely to be important factors behind the negative influences on B-cell function exerted by a diabetic state in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",0,suckling rats; food-restricted rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",[3-14C] beta HB,NS,NS

The animals were treated from postnatal day 2 (P2) to 21 (P21) by a daily subcutaneous injection of 10 mg/kg DZP or of the dissolution vehicle and studied at P5, P10, P14 and P21, together with an additional group of food-restricted rats obtained by an increase in litter size. DZP treatment induced a 9-26% decrease in body and brain weight. Undernutrition decreased body weight by 20-24% at all ages whereas brain weight was relatively spared. DZP and N-desmethyldiazepam concentrations decreased with age and were cleared from brain and plasma by 6-8 hrs after the injection. DZP decreased plasma glucose concentrations by 6-12% at P5, P14 and P21, whereas undernutrition did not change plasma glucose concentrations, except for a 7% decrease at P14. DZP treatment had no consequences on circulating concentrations of both ketone bodies while undernutrition increased their concentration by 45-362% at all ages. The conversion of [14C]glucose into cerebral amino acids was reduced by DZP at P5 and P10. The cerebral concentration of neurotransmitter amino acids was not affected by DZP treatment which only increased the amount of neutral amino acids mainly in the cerebellum at P5 and P10. After [U-14C]glucose injection, specific radioactivities of cerebral amino acids were mostly decreased by DZP from P5 to P14 and significantly increased at P21. With [3-14C] beta HB as a precursor, specific radioactivities of neurotransmitter amino acids were increased by DZP. In conclusion, P5 and P10 rats appear to be most sensitive to DZP effects whereas some tolerance to the drug seems to develop by P21. The lack of effects of DZP on blood ketone body concentrations compared to food restriction as well as the relative sparing of brain weight in undernourished rats confirms that the cerebral metabolic consequences of early DZP exposure on brain energy metabolism are mostly direct effects not mediated by sedation-induced undernutrition.",0,normal volunteers,human,Human – Interventional,"glycemic threshold, up",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypoglycemia,Metabolic & Endocrine,"autonomic symptoms, down; neuroglycopenic symptoms, down; counterregulatory hormone responses, down; cognitive dysfunction, down","Autonomic symptoms, down; Neurological deficit score, down; Hormone response, down; Cognition, down",infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

During hypoglycemia associated with prolonged fasting or strenuous exercise, circulating ketone-body and lactate levels increase several-fold; in both situations, certain signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia are diminished. Therefore, to test the hypothesis that hyperketonemia or hyperlacticacidemia of the magnitude seen during certain clinical situations can substitute for glucose as an energy source for the brain and alter physiological responses to hypoglycemia, we assessed autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms, counterregulatory hormone responses, and cognitive function during standardized insulin-induced hypoglycemia in normal volunteers with and without infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) or lactate designed to reproduce circulating levels of these substrates seen during prolonged fasting and strenuous exercise. Compared with paired control experiments, infusion of BOHB and lactate increased the glycemic threshold (required greater hypoglycemia for initiation) and reduced the magnitude of autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms, counterregulatory hormone responses, and cognitive dysfunction (all P < 0.05). The hypoglycemic threshold for autonomic symptoms increased from 3.8 +/- 0.1 to 3.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/l during BOHB infusion and from 3.7 +/- 0.1 to 2.8 +/- 0.1 mmol/l during lactate infusion, and the threshold for neuroglycopenic symptoms increased from 2.8 +/- 0.1 to 2.4 +/- 0.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, respectively.

Nevertheless, administration of glucose to critically ill patients with central nervous system trauma may have adverse effects on their neurologic recovery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of other sources of nonprotein calories on spinal cord lactate accumulation and on electrophysiologic recovery after a period of severe spinal cord ischemia. DESIGN: Two randomized, blinded studies were performed: one of glycolytic energy substrates (fructose, xylitol, sorbitol, glycerol) and one of ketogenic energy substrates (beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetate, butyrate). SETTING: College teaching hospital laboratory. SUBJECTS: New Zealand albino rabbits (weight 3.5 to 4.5 kg). INTERVENTIONS: After infusion of the randomly assigned treatment, temporary ischemia was produced in the lumbosacral spinal cord by occluding the abdominal aorta with a balloon catheter. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood concentrations of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies and spinal cord dialysate concentration of lactate were measured before and after infusion of the assigned treatment, and during ischemia and during the first 2 hrs after reperfusion. Spinal somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded during ischemia to assure a similar severity of ischemia in all animals and during the first 2 hrs after reperfusion as a measure of electrophysiologic recovery. Infusion of the glycolytic nutrients xylitol and fructose increased blood glucose and lactate concentrations, and resulted in increased lactate accumulation in the spinal cord during ischemia and resulted in a significantly poorer recovery of the spinal somatosensory evoked potential than infusion of saline. Infusion of sorbitol and glycerol did not have these adverse effects in the doses administered. None of the ketogenic nutrients increased blood glucose concentration or increased lactate accumulation in the spinal cord during ischemia when compared with infusion of saline. Infusion of butyrate and acetate caused arterial hypotension and resulted in a poorer recovery of the spinal somatosensory evoked potential than saline. Infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate did not have an adverse effect on blood pressure or on evoked potential recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Glycerol, sorbitol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate deserve further evaluation as potential nonprotein calorie sources in patients with neurologic injury. Xylitol and fructose are not suitable since these substrates resulted in hyperglycemia and increased lactate accumulation in the central nervous system, and had detrimental effects on electrophysiologic recovery after ischemia. The short-chain fatty acids (acetate and butyrate) also had adverse effects on electrophysiologic recovery after ischemia, probably because of their hypotensive effects when given intravenously, rather than from the effects of their metabolism.",0,rabbit cornea; rabbit corneal cells; human cornea,animal; human; in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"lactate production, down",Metabolic Regulation,cornea,Eye/Retina,endothelial cells,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan","D,L-racemic mixture (12-15 mM)",In vitro media supplementation,racemic

Parameters included the effect on growth of corneal cells, retention of metabolic activity of human and rabbit corneas under storage, and the integrity of the endothelium and physiological function of the cornea in vivo. The experiments revealed that beta-hydroxybutyrate enhances the growth of all three cell types of rabbit corneas, with an optimal concentration estimated at about 12-15 mM of D,L-racemic mixture. It is more efficient than glucose for elevating the tissue energy charge. When stored in an NaHCO3-free isotonic medium supplemented with beta-hydroxybutyrate at 4 degrees C, lactate production and accumulation in the cornea were reduced by > 85% and metabolic activity was retained at a markedly high level for at least 11 days, as opposed to about 3 days when stored in McCarey-Kaufman medium. When beta-hydroxybutyrate in a balanced salt solution was infused into the anterior chamber, the cornea performed its physiologic function normally without NaHCO3 and no remarkable postoperational changes in morphology and density of endothelial cells were evident. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that non-lactate-generating metabolites are efficient substrates for donor tissues. No NaHCO3 supplement is needed when beta-hydroxybutyrate is used. The solution is therefore stable in pH, and thereby favorable for clinical applications.",0,ICU patients with sepsis; healthy normal subjects,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"lipolysis, down; glucose production, down",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Sepsis,Infectious,"protein metabolism, no-change","Protein metabolism, no-change",D-beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized trial. SETTING: Intensive care unit (ICU) and metabolic unit at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twelve ICU patients with sepsis and six healthy normal subjects. INTERVENTIONS: Septic patients were administered 4-hr infusions of either D-beta-hydroxybutyrate or a control solution, 12 hrs after parenteral nutrition was replaced with an isotonic saline infusion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The appearance and oxidation rates of leucine (L[1-13C]leucine) and endogenous glucose production (D[6,6-2H2]glucose), plasma fatty acids, and glycerol values were measured before and at the end of infusion of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate or control solution. Unlike the control test, the D-beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion decreased glucose production, fatty acids, and glycerol concentrations, but failed to decrease the leucine oxidation rate. CONCLUSION: Exogenous ketone-bodies infusion decreased lipolysis and glucose production in septic patients but had no beneficial effect on protein metabolism, as evaluated with L[1-13C]leucine.",0,dog heart in vivo,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"redirecting glucose from glycolysis to glycogen synthesis, up",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"glycogen synthesis, up","Glycogen synthesis, up",venous infusion,Intravenous BHB,NS

[1-13C]glycogen was monitored in hearts during an intravenous infusion of 20 mU/min insulin and glucose while [1-13C]glucose (10 mg/min) was infused into the left anterior descending coronary artery. When 1 mmol/min of lactate, pyruvate, or beta-hydroxybutyrate was added to the venous infusion, the measured rate of glycogen synthesis was increased, on average, sixfold. It was not increased further after a subsequent 10-min infusion of 5 micrograms/min epinephrine. Lactate extraction increased from 0.18 +/- 0.05 to 0.62 +/- 0.11 mumol.min-1.g wet wt-1 during lactate infusion, whereas glucose extraction did not change significantly (0.15 +/- 0.05 mumol.min-1.g wet wt-1 at 45 min of insulin and glucose infusion to 0.09 +/- 0.02 mumol.min-1.g wet wt-1 at 45 min of the lactate infusion). Therefore, the uptake and oxidation of circulating nonglucose substrates redirects the fate of extracted glucose from glycolysis to glycogen synthesis in the dog heart in vivo.",0,rapid fructose infusion; ischemic forearm exercise; 10 normal subjects (low-phosphate); 7 normal subjects (high-phosphate),human,NS; Human – Interventional; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"ATP resynthesis, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,muscle and liver,Multi-tissue,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",infusion,NS,NS
8067397,beta-Hydroxybutyrate decreases adenosine triphosphate degradation products in human subjects.,"Many disease states decrease intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and elevate body fluid purine levels. The use of specific metabolic substrates may reverse this process. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that beta-hydroxybutyrate, a substrate for ATP synthesis, decreases body fluid purine levels during interventions that induce ATP degradation. Decreases in these purine levels are metabolic markers for diminished ATP degradation. Two human models for stimulating ATP degradation were used to test the hypothesis. Rapid fructose infusion causes acute degradation of hepatic ATP, and ischemic exercise stimulates ATP consumption in skeletal muscle. The activity of beta-hydroxybutyrate was used in combination with phosphate, another important substrate for ATP synthesis. The studies were performed during a low-phosphate state in 10 normal subjects and during a high-phosphate state in 7 normal subjects. Metabolic variables, such as serum or urinary phosphate level, blood beta-hydroxybutyrate level, blood acetoacetate level, plasma or urinary purine level, blood lactate level, and blood ammonia level, were monitored during the study. After ischemic exercise of the forearm muscle, beta-hydroxybutyrate decreased the level of plasma total purines, blood lactate, and blood ammonia during the low-phosphate state but not during the high-phosphate state. During fructose-induced hepatic ATP breakdown, beta-hydroxybutyrate decreased late phase plasma purine increases under low-phosphate conditions only and decreased urinary total and radiolabeled purine elevations under both phosphate conditions. These data indicate that the infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate may alter the balance from ATP degradation toward ATP resynthesis in muscle and liver by providing an immediate source of fuel and reducing equivalents under under specific metabolic conditions. This activity in combination with other metabolic interventions may have therapeutic value by restoring ATP pools in ATP-depleted tissues.",0,isolated working rat heart,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"glycogen resynthesis, up",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Multi-disease,"functional recovery, no-change","Neurological deficit score, no-change",dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate (10 mM),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

The following variables were studied: feeding and fasting in vivo, addition of L-lactate (10 mM), dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate (10 mM), glucagon (0.01 and 1 micrograms/ml), and a 15-min anoxic perfusion before ischemia in vitro. Recovery was assessed as the percentage of preischemic power. Good correlation was found between functional recovery and the postischemic content of glycogen. Glycogen depletion by anoxia or glucagon before ischemia impaired recovery. There was no relationship among lactate produced, or the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, and recovery. The addition of lactate or beta-hydroxybutyrate to hearts from fed rats increased the content of glycogen and glucose 6-phosphate, whereas addition of lactate, but not beta-hydroxybutyrate, improved recovery. There was a linear relationship between glycogen content and glucose 6-phosphate levels. In conclusion, the degree of return of oxidative metabolism and of net glycogen resynthesis reflects postischemic recovery of function. The results also suggest a role for anaplerosis of the citric acid cycle as an additional determinant of postischemic recovery.",0,B6C3F1 two-cell embryos,animal; in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal,"embryo development, down","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",preimplantation embryo,Systemic/Whole organism,two-cell embryo,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"preimplantation embryo development, down","Embryo development, down",racemic mixture of DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (16 and 32 mM),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

We have shown previously that poorly controlled diabetes mellitus impairs in-vivo and in-vitro mouse preimplantation embryo growth, and that culturing embryos in elevated glucose concentrations only partially recreates this developmental delay. To extend this observation we examined the effect on mouse preimplantation embryo growth of elevated concentrations of other metabolic intermediates, which may be deranged in diabetes mellitus, namely lipids, lactate, glycerol, amino acids, and ketones. Two-cell embryos from ovulation-induced B6C3F1 mice were cultured for 72 h in the presence of added lipids (250 mg/dl), lactate (5 mM), glycerol (160 microM) or mixed amino acids (8.5% travasol, 7 mM) and showed no significant difference in growth over 72 h versus their control groups. However, growth of preimplantation embryos in acetoacetate (10 mM) or in the racemic mixture of DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (16 and 32 mM) revealed marked retardation versus controls when assessed either by distribution of developmental stages over time (24, 48, 72 h, P < 0.001) or by the difference in the average rank of sums indicating a delay in maturation (P < 0.0001). We conclude that elevated ketone concentrations adversely affect preimplantation embryo development. These findings extend previous studies which correlate uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as well as hyperglycaemia with abnormal organogenesis, and demonstrate that exposure to metabolic derangements may also hinder reproductive performance at even earlier stages in gestation.",0,six healthy human volunteers,human,Human – Interventional,"respiratory exchange ratio, down",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Respiratory failure,Respiratory,"respiratory requirements, down","Pulmonary function, down",sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate,Multi-source,NS

However, this potential decrease in respiratory work was observed to be offset by significant thermogenesis. The metabolic effects of sodium acetate, sodium lactate, and sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate, infused at a rate of 20 mumol.kg-1.min-1 for 3 h, was monitored in six healthy human volunteers. Respiratory exchange ratio decreased from 0.85 +/- 0.02 at baseline to 0.75 +/- 0.02, 0.75 +/- 0.02, and 0.80 +/- 0.02, after acetate, lactate, or beta-hydroxybutyrate, respectively (P < 0.05 for each). Acetate produced a larger thermic effect (22.7% of energy infused) than did lactate (16.3%) or beta-hydroxybutyrate (13.6%). Thus, sodium salts of organic acids may potentially decrease the respiratory requirements by decreasing the respiratory exchange ratio. However, this effect is partially offset by the thermic effect of these substrates.

Anesthetized dogs were ventilated and instrumental for arterial and cerebral venous blood sampling, taken during baseline, infusion, test, and recovery periods. Each dog received one of four different beta-hydroxybutyrate doses and 25 min of either a normoxic or hypoxic (8% oxygen) test period. Arterial glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate were stable in the saline and 3 mg.kg-1 x min-1 beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion groups, but glucose declined and beta-hydroxybutyrate increased in the 10 and 20 mg.kg-1 x min-1 beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion groups. During normoxia glucose arteriovenous differences across the brain decreased significantly only in the 20 mg.kg-1 x min-1 beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion groups, and during hypoxia the differences decreased for all groups. beta-Hydroxybutyrate arteriovenous differences tended to increase with a 100-fold increase in beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, but the trend was not statistically significant. Hypoxia further decreased glucose extraction, but did not change beta-hydroxybutyrate extraction.

The purpose of this study was to test whether BD-induced hyperketonemia was associated with changes in brain extracellular and tissue concentrations of BHB. Changes in extracellular levels of BHB were continuously monitored in anesthetized rats before and after intraperitoneal injection of BD (25 mmol/kg), using intracerebral microdialysis coupled to online analysis of BHB in the dialysate. Cortical tissue concentrations of BHB were determined in control and BD-treated rats (25 and 50 mmol/kg, i.p.) after freezing of the brain in situ. Butanediol produced a rapid increase in dialysate levels of BHB, with a linear relationship between dialysate and plasma BHB concentrations (r = 0.81, p < 0.001). In contrast, and although brain tissue levels of BHB were markedly increased after BD treatment, they were not related to the plasma concentration of BHB. Our results suggest that BHB produced from BD did not accumulate in brain and that BD protects against hypoxia or ischemia by increasing brain BHB availability.",0,10 normal volunteers,human,Human – Interventional,"brain metabolism contribution, no-change",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypoglycemia,Metabolic & Endocrine,"glycaemic threshold, no-change; counterregulatory hormones, no-change; symptoms (autonomic and neuroglycopenic), no-change; cognitive function (psychomotor tests), no-change","Glycemic control, no-change; Counterregulatory hormones, no-change; Symptoms, no-change; Cognition, no-change",endogenous hyperketonaemia,NS,NS
8307896,Post-hypoglycaemic hyperketonaemia does not contribute to brain metabolism during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in humans.,"It is controversial as to whether ketone bodies are utilized by the human brain as a fuel alternative to glucose during hypoglycaemia. To clarify the issue, we studied 10 normal volunteers during an experimental hypoglycaemia closely mimicking the clinical hypoglycaemia of patients with Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus or insulinoma. Hypoglycaemia was induced by a continuous infusion of insulin (0.40 mU.kg-1.min-1 for 8 h, plasma insulin approximately 180 pmol/l) which decreased the plasma glucose concentration to approximately 3.1 mmol/l during the last 3 h of the studies. Subjects were studied on two occasions, i.e. spontaneous, counterregulatory-induced post-hypoglycaemic increase in 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (from approximately 0.2 to approximately 1.1 mmol/l at 8 h), or prevention of post-hypoglycaemic hyperketonaemia (plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate approximately 0.1 mmol/l throughout the study) after administration of acipimox, a potent inhibitor of lipolysis. In the latter study, glucose was infused to match the hypoglycaemia observed in the former study. The glycaemic thresholds and overall responses of counterregulatory hormones, symptoms (both autonomic and neuroglycopenic), and deterioration of cognitive function (psychomotor tests) were superimposable in the control study in which ketones increased spontaneously after onset of hypoglycaemic counterregulation, as compared to the study in which ketones were suppressed (p = NS). The fact that responses of counterregulatory hormones, symptoms and deterioration in cognitive function were not exaggerated when posthypoglycaemic hyperketonaemia was prevented, indicate that during hypoglycaemia, the counterregulatory-induced endogenous hyperketonaemia does not provide the human brain with an alternative substrate to glucose. Thus, it is concluded that during hypoglycaemia, endogenous hyperketonaemia does not contribute to brain metabolism and function.",0,Male Wistar rats; streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats; one-week fasted rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"degradation of tissue glycogen, up",Metabolic Regulation,myocardium,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"myocardial glycogen concentration, down","Glycogen concentration, down",beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Before Langendorff perfusion, tissue glycogen concentrations in control, diabetic, and fasted hearts were 3.3 +/- 0.2, 10.0 +/- 0.9, and 5.7 +/- 0.5 (mg/g wet weight), respectively. In diabetic rats, the myocardial glycogen concentration was markedly decreased after working heart perfusion of any of the substrate combinations, even those with insulin and BHB.

Such a behaviour could however be obtained with young mitochondria when partially uncoupled. The negative effect of the presence of uncoupled mitochondria could be overcome by addition of a ketone body: D(-) beta-hydroxybutyrate. When comparisons were performed between injected young and old fibroblasts, old cells were found less efficient in counteracting the presence of uncoupled mitochondria.

Thyrotoxicity was induced by daily subcutaneous injection of thyroxine (100 micrograms/kg/day) for 7 days, and diabetes mellitus was induced by intraperitoneal streptozotocin (50 mg/kg) injection.

In perfused hindquarter, the uptake of AcAc and BOHB was significantly reduced in starved and diabetic rats, but not in thyrotoxic rats. In perfused kidney, the uptake of AcAc and BOHB was not significantly different between the experimental and control rats.

The effect of the interaction of noradrenaline with ATP on the release of beta-hydroxybutyrate.,"The regulatory mechanism of ketone-body output by the hepatic sympathetic nerves was studied in rat liver perfused in situ. Enrichment of the perfusion medium with 1 mM octanoate increased the basal ketone-body output from the liver up to 1.5 mumol.min-1.g liver-1. Under these conditions, electrical stimulation of the hepatic nerves (20 V, 20 Hz, 2 ms) decreased the output of both acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, and was accompanied by an accumulation of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the liver. The effects of nerve stimulation were inhibited by the alpha 1-antagonist bunazosin (10 microM). However, noradrenaline, a typical sympathetic neurotransmitter, at a concentration of 1 microM decreased the output of acetoacetate but did not affect beta-hydroxybutyrate output. Prostaglandin F2 alpha at a concentration of 10 microM produced an effect similar to treatment with noradrenaline, without a decrease in beta-hydroxybutyrate output. ATP at 50 microM, however, decreased the output of both acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate and increased the tissue concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate, mimicking the effect of nerve stimulation. Moreover, in the presence of 0.2 microM ATP, a concentration that produced neither metabolic nor hemodynamic changes, noradrenaline (1 microM) was shown to decrease the beta-hydroxybutyrate output. These results indicate the possible involvement of ATP in the action of hepatic sympathetic nerves on beta-hydroxybutyrate output from the liver, presumably through its interaction with noradrenaline.",0,pregnant women with pregestational diabetes mellitus; pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,neurodevelopmental course,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Psychomotor developmental delay,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"psychomotor/motor test scores, NS","Motor function, NS",maternal beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

STUDY DESIGN: One hundred ninety-six pregnant women and their singleton offspring participated in this prospective cohort-analytic study. Ninety-five women had pregestational diabetes mellitus, and 101 women had gestational diabetes mellitus. Serial estimates of circulating maternal fuels were obtained throughout each index pregnancy along with detailed records of the perinatal course and outcome. Offspring were administered the psychomotor development index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at age 2 years and the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test Of Motor Proficiency at ages 6, 8, and 9 years. Tests were performed blinded to the mother's antepartum metabolic status, and perinatal history, and the child's previous test scores. Partial correlations and analyses of covariance were used to control for other influences and confounds, such as family socioeconomic status, racial or ethnic origin, patient group (i.e., pregestational or gestational diabetes mellitus), and sex of child. RESULTS: Children's average score on the Bruininks-Oseretsky test at ages 6 to 9 years correlated significantly with maternal second (p < 0.02) and third trimester (p < 0.001) beta-hydroxybutyrate. There was also a borderline association between the children's scores on the psychomotor development index at age 2 years and maternal third-trimester beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (p = 0.06). No other correlations approached significance. CONCLUSIONS: Intrauterine metabolic experiences continue to influence the neurodevelopmental course in offspring of diabetic mothers.

STUDY DESIGN: First-trimester trophoblasts were obtained by transabdominal chorionic villus sampling for subsequent cytogenetic analysis. The cells were established as a continuous line exhibiting trophoblast characteristics. Trophoblasts were cultured in Ham's F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. Experiments were initiated by a 24-hour preincubation in serum-free Ham's F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium followed by incubation with ketoacids (acetoacetic acid and beta-hydroxybutyrate, 0 to 10 mmol/L) in the presence or absence of insulin-like growth factor-I (100 ng/ml). The cells were challenged with 2-deoxy-[1,2-3H]D-glucose (0.1 mmol/L) for 5 minutes and then cell-associated radioactivity was measured. Total ribonucleic acid was extracted from cells incubated with ketoacids in the presence or absence of insulin-like growth factor-I, and Northern blots were probed with a phosphorus 32-labeled complementary deoxyribonucleic acid fragment encoding the rat GLUT 1. RESULTS: Ketoacids caused a dose-dependent inhibition of glucose transport. At 5 mmol/L acetoacetic acid there was a > 50% reduction in the rate of glucose transport in both control and insulin-like growth factor-I-treated cells. The diminution in glucose uptake by trophoblasts was not due to cellular toxicity of the ketoacids because there was no significant difference in trypan blue exclusion or lactate dehydrogenase release between control and ketoacid-treated cells. Northern analysis revealed that the steady-state expression of GLUT1 messenger ribonucleic acid was diminished in ketone-treated cells, but this effect was overcome by coincubation of cultures with insulin or insulin-like growth factor-I. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ketoacids can suppress the uptake of glucose into first-trimester human trophoblasts. Because ketoacidosis in pregnant women with diabetes mellitus is a frequent clinical consequence of poor metabolic control, it is possible that elevated levels of acetoacetic acid and beta-hydroxybutyrate may impair the transport of glucose across the placental trophoblast and into the fetal circulation.",0; BDH1,sheep; isolated ruminal epithelial cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal; In vitro – Primary cells,"shift in mitochondrial NADH/NAD status, NS",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,ruminal epithelium,Stomach,ruminal epithelial cells,Epithelial – Gastrointestinal,GI epithelium (unspecified),mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",butyrate,NS,NS

Cells were incubated in the presence of various combinations of butyrate (0, .5, 1, 5, 10, or 25 mM), propionate (0, .1, .5, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 mM), acetate (0, .5, 1, 5, 25, 50, or 100 mM), and succinate (0, 5, 15, 50 mM) to evaluate the effects of these substrates on butyrate metabolism. Variables measured included beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HBA) and acetoacetate (AcAc) production from butyrate, [14C]butyrate oxidation to 14CO2, and lactate and pyruvate formation from propionate and succinate. Butyrate oxidation to CO2, beta-HBA and total ketones produced (nanomoles of butyrate metabolized per 10(6) cells per minute) were linear over the 2-h incubation period (y = .805X + 2.24, r2 = .78; y = 1.02X - 9.1, r2 = .72; and y = 2.238X - 11.76, r2 = .65, respectively). Acetate inhibited beta-HBA formation from butyrate (P < .05) when present at concentrations greater than 5 mM, although a dose-dependence was not consistently exhibited. However, butyrate oxidation to beta-HBA was stimulated (P < .05) by propionate while acetoacetate production declined (P < .05), resulting in no net change in ketone body production (P > .05). A concomitant increase in lactate and pyruvate production was noted with increasing concentrations of propionate. Succinate addition also increased lactate production by the ruminal epithelial cells. In contrast to propionate, succinate addition resulted in a decrease in beta-HBA formation from butyrate (P < .05). Butyrate metabolism by isolated ruminal epithelial cells is influenced by other VFA produced in the rumen, and propionate-induced stimulation of beta-HBA from butyrate does not seem to be mediated via succinate but rather is a result of a shift in the mitochondrial NADH/NAD status.",0,intact liver mitochondria,in vitro,Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"intramitochondrial pyridine nucleotide oxidation and hydrolysis, up",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NAD(+)-linked substrate beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
8914959,Control of the pyridine nucleotide-linked Ca2+ release from mitochondria by respiratory substrates.,"Oxidation of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides followed by their hydrolysis promotes Ca2+ release from intact liver mitochondria. In most of the previous studies oxidation was achieved with pro-oxidants which were added to mitochondria respiring on succinate in the presence of rotenone, a site I-specific inhibitor of the respiratory chain. Here we investigate pro-oxidant dependent and independent Ca2+ release from mitochondria when respiration is supported either by the NAD(+)-linked substrate beta-hydroxybutyrate, or by succinate. In the presence, as well as in the absence, of the pro-oxidant t-butylhydroperoxide mitochondria retain Ca2+ much better with succinate than with beta-hydroxybutyrate as respiratory substrate. When Ca2+ release is induced by t-butylhydroperoxide succinate-supported Ca2+ retention is impeded by rotenone. Ca2+ release (pro-oxidant dependent or independent) is paralleled by oxidation and hydrolysis of intramitochondrial pyridine nucleotides, and Ca2+ retention is paralleled by reduction of pyridine nucleotides. It is concluded that the pyridine nucleotide-linked Ca2+ release from mitochondria can be controlled by respiratory substrates which regulate the intramitochondrial hydrolysis of oxidized pyridine nucleotides.",0,male rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"beta-hydroxybutyrate oxidation, down",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",sodium salt of beta-hydroxybutyrate,Multi-source,NS

Male rats were given 20 mmol/L sodium pivalate for 2 wk to induce a secondary carnitine deficiency. Control animals were given 20 mmol/L sodium bicarbonate in their drinking water. In the ketone utilization experiment, rats were food-deprived for 24 h and infused with the sodium salt of beta-hydroxybutyrate to maintain total plasma ketone concentrations between 6.0 and 10.0 mmol/L. After a bolus of 3-hydroxy[3-14C]butyrate, the recovery of expired 14CO2 collected during the ensuing 100 min was significantly lower in the pivalate-treated rats than in the controls (P < 0.05). In the second experiment, blood samples from pivalate-treated and control rats were collected from the abdominal aorta, portal vein and hepatic vein to determine the hepatic balance (hepatic input - hepatic output) of ketone bodies and free fatty acids. No significant differences were seen between the two treatment groups for either ketone bodies or free fatty acids. We conclude that the higher plasma ketone concentrations seen in food-deprived, pivalate-treated rats were due to a lower rate of ketone utilization. No evidence of pivalate influence upon ketone production was found.",0,synaptosomes,in vitro,Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"glutamate content, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,synaptosomes,NS,nerve endings,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"epilepsy treatment benefit, positive","Seizure protection, positive",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
8967461,"Regulation of GABA level in rat brain synaptosomes: fluxes through enzymes of the GABA shunt and effects of glutamate, calcium, and ketone bodies.","Stable isotopes were used to measure both the rate of GABA formation by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and the rate of utilization by GABA-transaminase (GABA-T). The initial rate of GABA accumulation, determined with either [2-15N]glutamine or [2H5]glutamine as precursor, was 0.3-0.4 nmol/min/mg of protein. Addition of the calcium ionophore A23187 enhanced GAD activity, whereas changes in levels of inorganic phosphate and H+ were without influence. Flux through GABA-T (GABA--> glutamate), measured with [15N]GABA as precursor, was 0.82 nmol/min/mg of protein, whereas the reamination of succinic acid semialdehyde (reverse flux through GABA-T) was almost sixfold faster, 4.8 nmol/min/mg of protein. The rate of GABA metabolism via the tricarboxylic acid cycle was very slow, with the upper limit on flux being 0.03 nmol/min/mg of protein. Addition of either acetoacetate or beta-hydroxybutyrate raised the internal content of glutamate and reduced that of aspartate; the GABA concentration and the rate of its formation increased. It is concluded that in synaptosomes (a) GABA-T is a primary factor in regulating the turnover of GABA, (b) a major regulator of GAD activity is the concentration of internal calcium, (c) GAD in nerve endings may not be saturated with its substrate, glutamate, and the concentration of the latter is a determinant of flux through this pathway, and (d) levels of ketone bodies increase, and maintain at a higher value, the synaptosomal content of GABA, a phenomenon that may contribute to the beneficial effect of a ketogenic diet in the treatment of epilepsy.",0,human subjects,human,Human – Interventional,"oxidation of ketone bodies, up",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cerebral ketone uptake, up; cerebral glucose metabolism, down; global cerebral oxygen metabolism, no-change; global cerebral blood flow, up","Ketone utilization, up; Glucose metabolism, down; Oxygen delivery, no-change; Cerebral blood flow, up",intravenous infusion with ketone bodies,Intravenous BHB,NS

To investigate if this shift is directly coupled to circulating blood concentrations of ketone bodies, we measured global cerebral blood flow (CBF) and global cerebral carbohydrate metabolism with the Kety-Schmidt technique before and during intravenous infusion with ketone bodies. During acute hyperketonemia (mean beta-hydroxybutyrate blood concentration 2.16 mM), cerebral uptake of ketones increased from 1.11 to 5.60 mumol.100 g-1.min-1, counterbalanced by an equivalent reduction of the cerebral glucose metabolism from 25.8 to 17.2 mumol.100 g-1.min-1, with the net result being an unchanged cerebral uptake of carbohydrates. In accordance with this, global cerebral oxygen metabolism was not significantly altered (144 vs. 135 mumol.100 g-1.min-1). The unchanged global cerebral metabolic activity was accompanied by a 39% increase in CBF from 51.0 to 70.9 ml.100 g-1.min-1. Regional analysis of the glucose metabolism by positron emission tomography-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose indicated that mesencephalon does not oxidize ketone bodies to the same extent as the rest of the brain. It was concluded that the immediate oxidation of ketone bodies induced a decrease in cerebral glucose uptake in spite of an adequate glucose supply to the brain. Furthermore, acute hyperketonemia caused a resetting of the coupling between CBF and metabolism that could not be explained by alterations in arterial CO2 tension or pH.",0,34 normal 4-day-fasted volunteers; 9 acipimox-treated subjects with intravenous beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion,human,Human – Interventional,"gluconeogenesis, down",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",intravenous beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
8974150,Role of fat-derived substrates in the regulation of gluconeogenesis during fasting.,"To determine the role of fat-derived substrates in the regulation of glucose metabolism during fasting, glucose turnover, urea nitrogen production, alanine conversion to glucose, and substrate oxidation rates were measured in 34 normal 4-day-fasted volunteers treated with the antilipolytic drug acipimox or placebo for 8 h. The approximately 50% inhibition of lipolysis induced by acipimox increased glucose concentration and production, respectively, by approximately 35 and approximately 30%, whereas the protein breakdown and the amount of alanine converted to glucose were increased, respectively, by approximately 70 and approximately 85%. Insulin levels were reduced by approximately 40%, cortisol levels doubled, and growth hormone concentration increased sevenfold. The relative contribution of free fatty acid (FFA) and ketone body lowering to the observed response was evaluated in nine acipimox-treated subjects in whom ketone body concentration was clamped with an intravenous beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion. The results of these experiments suggest that, during fasting, both FFA and ketone bodies tend to suppress gluconceogenesis and to protect the protein stores. FFA seem to exert their effects mainly through their ability to modulate the hormonal milieu (especially insulin), whereas ketone bodies seem to act mainly by other mechanisms. Thus the widespread view according to which FFA exert a stimulatory role on gluconeogenesis does not apply to the fasting state in vivo.",0,rat tail artery,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"contraction recovery, up (weak; transient), nan","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation; Other / Unspecified",tail artery,Vasculature,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
9032447,Exogenous substrates as energy source for the contractile activity of the isolated rat tail artery.,"The isolated rat tail artery underwent a pronounced depression of the contractile responses to adrenaline during the incubation in a glucose-free medium containing 2-deoxyglucose and/or oxfenicine in order to inhibit the utilization of glycogen and/or endogenous triacylglycerol. When glucose was returned after 90 min of exposure to oxfenicine, the contraction strength recovered completely. In the medium with 2-deoxyglucose the addition of palmitate or hexanoate produced a recovery level 28% and 16% below the control values respectively. The effect of palmitate was nearly abolished and that of hexanoate partially decreased in the medium containing both inhibitors. Under this condition pyruvate reestablished the extent of the contraction to about 80% of the control value whereas beta-hydroxybutyrate produced a weak and transient recovery. These data suggest that in the tail artery the major portion of the energy needed to sustain the contractile activity is supplied by the oxidation of the more important plasmatic substrates with the exception of ketone bodies. However the Embden-Meyerhof pathway seems necessary to maintain at least a fraction of the contraction strength.",0,rat cardiomyocytes; cardiomyocytes from fasted rats; cardiomyocytes from diabetic rats,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"plasma membrane glucose transporter abundance, down",Ion & Nutrient Transport,heart,Heart,cardiomyocyte,Muscle – Cardiac,Cardiomyocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
9075834,Glucose transport and glucose transporter GLUT4 are regulated by product(s) of intermediary metabolism in cardiomyocytes.,"Alternative substrates of energy metabolism are thought to contribute to the impairment of heart and muscle glucose utilization in insulin-resistant states. We have investigated the acute effects of substrates in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. Exposure to lactate, pyruvate, propionate, acetate, palmitate, beta-hydroxybutyrate or alpha-oxoglutarate led to the depression of glucose transport by up to 50%, with lactate, pyruvate and propionate being the most potent agents. The percentage inhibition was greater in cardiomyocytes in which glucose transport was stimulated with the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine or with a submaximal insulin concentration than in basal or fully insulin-stimulated cells. Cardiomyocytes from fasted or diabetic rats displayed a similar sensitivity to substrates as did cells from control animals. On the other hand, the amination product of pyruvate (alanine), as well as valine and the aminotransferase inhibitors cycloserine and amino-oxyacetate, stimulated glucose transport about 2-fold. In addition, the effect of pyruvate was counteracted by cycloserine. Since reversible transamination reactions are known to affect the pool size of the citrate cycle, the influence of substrates, amino acids and aminotransferase inhibitors on citrate, malate and glutamate content was examined. A significant negative correlation was found between alterations in glucose transport and the levels of citrate (P < 0.01) or malate (P < 0.01), and there was a positive correlation between glucose transport and glutamate levels (P < 0.05). In contrast, there was no correlation with changes in [1-(14)C]pyruvate oxidation or in glucose-6-phosphate levels. Finally, pyruvate decreased the abundance of GLUT4 glucose transporters at the surface of phenylephrine- or insulin-stimulated cells by 34% and 27 % respectively, as determined by using the selective photoaffinity label [3H]ATB-BMPA [[3H]2-N-[4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl]-1,3-bis-(D-man nos-4-yloxy)propyl-2-amine]. In conclusion, cardiomyocyte glucose transport is subject to counter-regulation by alternative substrates. The glucose transport system appears to be controlled by (a) compound(s) of intermediary metabolism (other than glucose 6-phosphate), but in a different way than pyruvate dehydrogenase. Transport inhibition eventually occurs via a decrease in the amount of glucose transporters in the plasma membrane.",0,rabbit cornea transplantation model,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"deturgescence, up",Other / Unspecified,cornea,Eye/Retina,endothelial cells,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"tissue viability, increased","Cell viability, increased",isotonic solution (IS) enriched with beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

The objective of this study was to verify these findings in terms of tissue viability in vivo. METHODS: Using a rabbit cornea transplantation model, efficacy of IS was studied and compared with McCarey-Kaufman medium, with or without beta-hydroxybutyrate, and other known media (Optisol and Likorol), with different properties and without beta-hydroxybutyrate. After storage at 4 degrees C for 6, 7, and 11 days, the corneas were grafted, and postoperative changes in corneal thickness, and endothelial cell density and morphology were monitored with a pachymeter and specular microscope. RESULTS: The experiments revealed that before grafting, IS effectively controlled tissue swelling for 7 days or longer, comparable to Optisol. When grafted, the IS-stored corneas deturgesced at high rates, with a short half-time (t1/2) for the de-swelling process, and the grafts remained thin and clear with an intact endothelium. This reflects excellent tissue viability. In the controls, the deturgescence process was extremely sluggish, with significantly lower rates and longer t1/2 (P= >0.01-0.05). Immediate swelling for 3-5 days after grafting was also observed with Optisol. These grafts had significant endothelium cell loss of 24-30% after 12 weeks (P= >0.01-0.02). CONCLUSIONS: IS is more efficacious than currently used media for sustaining the viability of donor corneas under cold storage. These findings may serve as a useful basis for future tests of IS in other organ storage systems.",0,female rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"energy partitioning to fat deposition, up",Metabolic Regulation,fat pad,Adipose tissue,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion,NS,NS

Female rats were divided into 2 groups and implanted with a 28-day osmotic pump connected to a lateral cerebroventricular cannula. One group was infused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and the other with beta HB for 28 days. The rats had free access to both a high-fat/low-carbohydrate and a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet (isocaloric) for the 28-day infusion period. The group infused with beta HB had a significantly lower body weight gain during the infusion period. Cumulative food intake increased in the same manner in both groups. Fat pad weights and carcass lipid content were significantly higher in beta HB rats, despite the equivalent caloric intake in both groups and the decreased body weight. Our observations are in accord with earlier studies indicating that beta HB infused ICV reduces body weight, but not necessarily food intake. Increased adiposity in association with decreased body weight change in beta HB-infused rats strongly suggests that energy is being partitioned to fat deposition at the expense of lean tissue growth when ketone bodies are infused into the cerebroventricles.",0,hepatocytes,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"mitochondrial NAD+ reduction, down",Multiple mechanisms,liver,Liver,hepatocytes,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cell death, down","Apoptosis, down",beta-Hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Using confocal microscopy, we visualized pyridine nucleotide oxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation induced by t-BuOOH. Reduced mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides (NADH and NADPH) were imaged by autofluorescence. Mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS, onset of MPT, and cell death were monitored with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), dichlorofluorescin, calcein, and propidium iodide, respectively. t-BuOOH rapidly oxidized mitochondrial NAD(P)H. Oxidation was biphasic, and the second slower phase occurred during mitochondrial ROS generation. Subsequently, MPT took place, mitochondria depolarized, and cells died. beta-Hydroxybutyrate, which reduces mitochondrial NAD+, delayed cell killing, but lactate, which reduces cytosolic NAD+, did not. Trifluoperazine, which inhibits MPT, did not block the initial oxidation of NAD(P)H but prevented the second phase of oxidation, partially blocked ROS formation, and preserved cell viability. The antioxidants, deferoxamine and diphenylphenylenediamine, also prevented the second phase of NAD(P)H oxidation. They also blocked ROS formation nearly completely and stopped cell killing. Both antioxidants also prevented the mitochondrial permeability transition and subsequent mitochondrial depolarization. In conclusion, NAD(P)H oxidation and ROS formation are critical events promoting MPT in oxidative injury and death of hepatocytes.",0,Rhodospirillum rubrum; mutant devoid of dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyltransferase,in vitro,Animal – Invertebrate; NS,"switch-off period, down",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

We now show that the decrease in nitrogenase activity upon addition of NAD+ to R. rubrum is due to modification of dinitrogenase reductase. There was no effect when NAD+ was added to a mutant of R. rubrum devoid of dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyltransferase, indicating that NAD+ 'switch-off' is an effect of the same regulatory system as ammonium 'switch-off'. We also show that oxaloacetate and alpha-ketoglutarate function as 'switch-off' effectors. On the other hand beta-hydroxybutyrate has the opposite effect by shortening the 'switch-off' period. Furthermore, by using an inhibitor of glutamate synthase the role of this enzyme in 'switch-off' was investigated. The results are discussed in relation to our proposal that changes in the concentration of NAD+ are involved in initiating 'switch-off'.",0,osteoclasts on bone; osteoclasts off bone,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"glucose transport, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,bone,Bone,osteoclasts,Bone & Cartilage,Osteoclasts,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketone bodies,NS,NS

This is the first study to directly examine the ability of various metabolites to serve as potential energy sources for osteoclastic bone resorption. Glucose, and to a lesser extent lactate, supported osteoclastic bone degradation. However, fatty acids (palmitate, myristate and stearate), essential amino acids plus 20 mM alanine, or ketone bodies (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and alpha-ketoglutarate) did not support bone degradation. Resorption declined to 10-30% of glucose controls when fatty acids or ketoacids were substituted for glucose. Resorption was glucose concentration dependent, with maximal activity at approximately 7 mM (K(M) approximately 3 mM). Glucose transport was linear for approximately 15 minutes, specific for D-glucose, and inhibited by cytochalasin B. Osteoclasts cultured on bone transported glucose at almost twice the rate of those off bone (Vmax 23 versus 13 nmols/mg/min, respectively) and medium acid accumulation paralleled glucose uptake, while the K(M) was unchanged. We conclude that glucose is the principal energy source required for bone degradation. Further, characteristics of glucose transport are consistent with the hypothesis that fluctuations in serum glucose concentration are an important component in regulation of osteoclastic bone degradation.",0,isolated microperfused rabbit renal proximal tubule S2 segments,animal; in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,renal proximal tubule S2 segment,Kidney,proximal tubule cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Change of amiloride-inhibitable K+ conductance.,"Isolated microperfused rabbit renal proximal tubule S2 segments, if incubated in conventional substrate containing HCO3- Ringer solution, exhibit lower cell membrane potentials (Vb) and elevated intracellular Na+ concentrations ([Na]i) compared to rat tubules in vivo. Assuming that these and other differences reflect insufficient metabolic and/or hormonal stimulation of the cells, we have used microelectrode techniques to test whether improving substrate supply and applying norepinephrine (NE, to compensate for the missing nerve supply) reverts Vb and [Na]i to values observed in vivo. Application of D-glucose (5.5 mmol/l) and additional application of pyruvate, lactate, or L-alanine (each 10 mmol/l), or bathing the tubules in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's tissue culture medium (DMEM) significantly increased Vb and, whenever tested, reduced [Na]i as compared to substrate-free or D-glucose-containing control solution and these effects could be prevented - as tested in the case of pyruvate - by inhibition of the Na/K pump with ouabain. However, high concentrations of acetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, or L-glutamine had no significant effect. The largest effect was obtained with joint application of DMEM and NE (10 micromol/l) which increased Vb from -42.8 +/- 1.3 mV (SEM) to -55.3 +/- 2.5 mV (n = 11). Interestingly we noticed that under the latter conditions the Vb response to bath application of 1 mmol/l amiloride virtually disappeared, i.e. it changed from a depolarization of +14.6 +/- 1.4 mV (in D-glucose Ringer solution) to +0.6 +/- 0.7 mV (in DMEM plus NE) (n = 8), with some tubules showing even a small hyperpolarization. The latter implies partial restoration of the in vivo behaviour, since in experiments on rat proximal tubules in vivo amiloride regularly hyperpolarized the cells (by -3.4 +/- 0.76 mV, n = 5). Obviously under conventional in vitro conditions an amiloride-inhibitable K+ conductance is activated which is inactive in vivo and also inactivates under improved conditions in vitro. In agreement with observations reported in the subsequent publication our results demonstrate that isolated proximal tubules undergo functional alterations which may be largely prevented by improved metabolic and stimulatory incubation conditions.",0,"rat hippocampal slices from 4-, 7-, 10-, 13- and 16-day-old; adult rats",animal; in vitro,Multi-model; Animal – Rat,"maintenance of high-energy phosphates, no-change",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,hippocampal slices,Brain/CNS,pyramidal cells,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHBA),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Hippocampal slices were prepared from 4-, 7-, 10-, 13- and 16-day-old and adult rats. The population spikes (PS) were recorded in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA3 area as the index of neural activity. ATP and creatine-phosphate (CrP) levels in each slice were determined during glucose deprivation and during replacement of glucose with lactate or OHBA. After deprivation of glucose, the PS of the slices from 4-, 7- and 10-day-old and adult rats decayed and extinguished in 30 min and the decay time was shortened according to the age of the rat. The levels of ATP and CrP in the slices also decreased, but to a lesser extent than the amplitudes of PS. After substitution of lactate or beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHBA) for glucose, PS of the adult rat disappeared as was the case with glucose deprivation, although the levels of high energy phosphates were well maintained. In the case of the immature rat, however, PS decayed more slowly. Especially in the case of 4-day-old rat, ATP and CrP in the slices were maintained as high as those under the initial concentrations and PS amplitude showed no decay even after 60 min. These results indicate that the presence of glucose is essential for neural activity in the adult rat, and lactate or OHBA cannot replace it for the maintenance of neural activity. In the immature rat, glucose metabolites such as lactate and OHBA are available for both neural activity as well as maintaining the levels of high-energy phosphates in the tissue slice.",SLC2A4; GYS1; 0,rat; working rat heart,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"mitochondrial [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio, down",Multiple mechanisms,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Insulin deficiency,Metabolic & Endocrine,"cardiac hydraulic work efficiency, up","Cardiac function, up",ratio of 4 mM D-beta-hydroxybutyrate and 1 mM acetoacetate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

Unexpectedly, insulin increased cardiac hydraulic work but decreased net glycolytic flux and O2 consumption, improving net cardiac efficiency by 28%. These improvements in physiologic performance and metabolic efficiency resulted from reduction of the mitochondrial free [NAD+]/[NADH] and oxidation of mitochondrial [coenzyme Q]/[coenzyme QH2], increasing the energy of the proton gradient between cytosolic and mitochondrial phases and leading to a doubling of the cytosolic free [sigmaATP]/[sigmaADP][sigmaPi]. The acute metabolic effects of insulin were qualitatively duplicated by addition of a ratio of 4 mM D-beta-hydroxybutyrate and 1 mM acetoacetate, and the increase in the efficiency was the same as with addition of insulin. Addition of both insulin and ketones to the glucose perfusate increased the efficiency of cardiac hydraulic work by 35%.

Hypoxia induced GSH efflux and cytotoxicity were also prevented by oxypurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, as well as by the polyphenolic antioxidant quercetin, suggesting that reactive oxygen species contributed to the GSH efflux and cell lysis.

This led to induction of encystment, which increased steadily with concomitant intracellular degradation of the polymer. Increase in encystment and PHB production were parallel up to 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose. Further increase in glucose reduced cyst formation but enhanced PHB accumulation. Replacement of glucose by n-butyl alcohol and metabolically related compounds identified crotonate as the best encystment inducer followed by beta-hydroxybutyrate and butyrate, but PHB production was inhibited in general. Supplementation of medium with these compounds enhanced the onset of encystment, and only beta-hydroxybutyrate increased PHB accumulation significantly.",0,fasted rats; working hearts,animal,Animal – Rat; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
9417880,Effects of insulin on glucose uptake by rat hearts during and after coronary flow reduction.,"We tested the hypothesis that low-flow ischemia increases glucose uptake and reduces insulin responsiveness. Working hearts from fasted rats were perfused with buffer containing glucose alone or glucose plus a second substrate (lactate, octanoate, or beta-hydroxybutyrate). Rates of glucose uptake were measured by 3H2O production from [2-3H]glucose. After 15 min of perfusion at a physiological workload, hearts were subjected to low-flow ischemia for 45 min, after which they were returned to control conditions for another 30 min. Insulin (1 mU/ml) was added before, during, or after the ischemic period. Cardiac power decreased by 70% with ischemia and returned to preischemic values on reperfusion in all groups. Low-flow ischemia increased lactate production, but the rate of glucose uptake during ischemia increased only when a second substrate was present. Hearts remained insulin responsive under all conditions. Insulin doubled glucose uptake when added under control conditions, during low-flow ischemia, and at the onset of the postischemic period. Insulin also increased net glycogen synthesis in postischemic hearts perfused with glucose and a second substrate. Thus insulin stimulates glucose uptake in normal and ischemic hearts of fasted rats, whereas ischemia stimulates glucose uptake only in the presence of a cosubstrate. The results are consistent with two separate intracellular signaling pathways for hexose transport, one that is sensitive to the metabolic requirements of the heart and another that is sensitive to insulin.",0,U937 cells; permeabilized cells; respiration-deficient cells,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line; In vitro – Primary cells,"electron transport stimulation, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,U937 cells,Immune system (unspecified lymphoid tissue),U937 cells,Hematopoietic / Immune,Monocytes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
9427727,"Stimulation of oxygen consumption promotes mitochondrial calcium accumulation, a process associated with, and causally linked to, enhanced formation of tert-butylhydroperoxide-induced DNA single-strand breaks.","The NADH-linked substrates pyruvate, L-glutamine, and beta-hydroxybutyrate, while enhancing the rate of oxygen consumption, also increased the formation of DNA single-strand breaks induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide in intact U937 cells. A cause-effect relationship between these two parameters was established by showing that: (a) rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I, abolished respiration and prevented the enhancement of the DNA-damaging response under all the above circumstances; (b) the membrane-impermeant, complex I-activating substrate L-malate gave similar results in permeabilized cells; and (c) none of the NADH-linked substrates affected the DNA-damaging response to tert-butylhydroperoxide in respiration-deficient cells. Stimulation of electron transport potentiated the DNA-cleaving ability of tert-butylhydroperoxide via a process involving enforced mitochondrial calcium accumulation in the absence of a discernible elevation in the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+. Finally, mitochondrial calcium was found to promote the mitochondrial formation of DNA-damaging levels of hydrogen peroxide. In conclusion, the data herein presented define a previously unexpected role of respiratory substrates in the control of the deleterious effects of an organic hydroperoxide at the level of genomic DNA. The enhanced DNA cleavage mediated by NADH-linked substrates in response to tert-butylhydroperoxide would appear to depend on a sequence of events involving stimulation of electron transport, mitochondrial accumulation of Ca2+, and mitochondrial formation of DNA-damaging levels of hydrogen peroxide via a Ca(2+)-dependent process.",0,women with anorexia nervosa; women with bulimia; female control subjects,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"reactivation of HbF production, up",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Anorexia nervosa; Bulimia nervosa,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"HbF fraction, up","HbF fraction, up",generated during starvation,Fasting / Caloric restriction (endogenous),NS
9435311,Fetal hemoglobin in starvation ketosis of young women.,"Ketones can reactivate the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in vitro and in vivo. A reactivation of HbF by ketones, which are generated during starvation, remains largely speculative. Therefore, we investigated HbF in 31 women with anorexia nervosa or bulimia, using both of these as models of intermittent starvation ketosis. For comparison, we also studied 42 female control subjects matched for age. beta-Hydroxybutyrate levels were higher in patients than in controls (460 +/- 90 v 110 +/- 20 mumol/L; P < .0001). We correlated beta-hydroxybutyrate, metabolic, and hematologic parameters with HbF. HbF was measured with high pressure liquid chromatography. The data were analyzed with logistic regression analysis. An elevated HbF fraction (> 0.87%) was observed four times as often in patients than in controls (29% v 7%, P = .01). After adjustment for age, we found HbF elevations associated with beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (P = .005). No other correlations between the various metabolic/ hematologic parameters and HbF were significant. In conclusion, beta-hydroxybutyrate generated in starvation is associated with increased levels of HbF. Thus, unrestrained lipolysis can produce beta-hydroxybutyrate in sufficient quantities to induce a clinically measurable amount of HbF. These findings suggest that intermittent ketosis might also explain some increases of HbF in type 1 diabetes and pregnancy.",PFKM; PDHA1,working rat hearts,animal,Animal – Rat,"inhibition of glucose utilization, down",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",5 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
9450500,Cyclic AMP suppresses the inhibition of glycolysis by alternative oxidizable substrates in the heart.,"In normoxic conditions, myocardial glucose utilization is inhibited when alternative oxidizable substrates are available. In this work we show that this inhibition is relieved in the presence of cAMP, and we studied the mechanism of this effect. Working rat hearts were perfused with 5.5 mM glucose alone (controls) or together with 5 mM lactate, 5 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate, or 1 mM palmitate. The effects of 0.1 mM chlorophenylthio-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), a cAMP analogue, were studied in each group. Glucose uptake, flux through 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity were inhibited in hearts perfused with alternative substrates, and addition of CPT-cAMP completely relieved the inhibition. The mechanism by which CPT-cAMP induced a preferential utilization of glucose was related to an increased glucose uptake and glycolysis, and to an activation of phosphorylase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, the well-known stimulator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. In vitro phosphorylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase by cAMP-dependent protein kinase increased the Vmax of the enzyme and decreased its sensitivity to the inhibitor citrate. Therefore, in hearts perfused with various oxidizable substrates, cAMP induces a preferential utilization of glucose by a concerted stimulation of glucose transport, glycolysis, glycogen breakdown, and glucose oxidation.",0,rat embryonic neural tissue; day 9 embryos; day 10 embryos; day 11 embryos; day 12 embryos,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Organoids/3D cultures; Animal – Other Mammal,"oxygen uptake and glucose utilization, down",Multiple mechanisms,embryonic neural tissue,Systemic/Whole organism,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetic pregnancy,Reproductive & Pregnancy,"oxygen uptake down (day9: -12.8%, nan; day10: -11.2%, nan; day11-12: no-change), nan; glucose utilization down (day11-12: -30%), nan; glucose utilization no-change (day9-10), nan","VO2max, nan; Body weight, nan; No change, nan; Glucose utilization, nan",high concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

In order to assess the immediate metabolic alterations in embryos caused by excess ketone bodies, we studied rat embryonic neural tissue exposed to a high concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate in vitro. Beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibited oxygen uptake of the neural tissue of day 9 and day 10 embryos by 12.8% and 1 1.2%, but did not affect that of day 11 and day 12 tissue. In contrast, glucose utilization of the neural tissue of day 9 and day 10 embryos was not altered. However, a 30% decrease in glucose utilization was observed in the neural tissue of day 11 and day 12 embryos exposed to beta-hydroxybutyrate. Thus, beta-hydroxybutyrate induced different metabolic alterations in the embryonic neural tissue during early and late organogenesis, which suggests different modes of teratogenic action of ketone bodies in different parts of gestation.",0,rat hippocampal slices; PND 15; PND 30; PND 120,animal; in vitro,Multi-model; NS,"energy substrate substitution, up",Metabolic Regulation,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Glucose deprivation,Metabolic & Endocrine,"EPSPs, up","Synaptic transmission, up",0.5-10 mM D-betaHB,In vitro media supplementation,D-BHB

After the depression of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) by 60 min of glucose deprivation, administration of 0.5-10 mM D-betaHB restored EPSPs in slices from postnatal day (PND) 15 rats but not in slices from PND 30 or 120 rats. At PND 15, adding D-betaHB to the media allowed robust long-term potentiation of EPSPs triggered by high frequency stimulation, and prevented the EPSP-spike facilitation that suggests hyperexcitability of neurons. Even after PND 15,D-betaHB blocked morphological changes produced by either glucose deprivation or glycolytic inhibition.

9519722,Electron transport-mediated wasteful consumption of NADH promotes the lethal response of U937 cells to tert-butylhydroperoxide.,"The toxicity of a short-term exposure to tert-butylhydroperoxide in U937 cells was markedly reduced by chemically or experimentally induced respiratory deficiency. Rotenone mitigated the lethal effects of the hydroperoxide over the same concentration-range in which the complex I inhibitor inhibited oxygen utilization. U937 cells that were made respiration deficient by growing them in the presence of either chloramphenicol or ethidium bromide, were in both circumstances highly resistant to tert-butylhydroperoxide. The improved survival was not a direct consequence of the absence of electron transport, but rather was attributable to the large amounts of NADH which accumulate in the mitochondria of chemically hypoxic or respiration-deficient cells. Indeed, the toxicity elicited by tert-butylhydroperoxide was also abolished by supplementation with either of two different NADH-linked substrates, namely pyruvate or beta-hydroxybutyrate. Accumulation of intramitochondrial NADH, and the resulting cytoprotective effects, was associated with prevention of the loss of nonprotein sulphydryls and mitochondrial membrane potential. Neither rotenone nor pyruvate reduced the toxicity of tert-butylhydroperoxide in thiol-depleted cells. Taken together, these results indicate that depletion of mitochondrial NADH is a critical event in the cytotoxic response to tert-butylhydroperoxide since this pyridine nucleotide prevents mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death caused by the hydroperoxide. As a consequence, in hydroperoxide-treated cells electron transport is highly detrimental since it consumes mitochondrial NADH.",0,rat; dispersed rat embryonic cells; day 10 embryos; day 12 embryos; normal rats; diabetic rats,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Organoids/3D cultures,"mitochondrial oxidative events, up",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,embryonic cells,Systemic/Whole organism,embryonic cells,Stem / Progenitor / Pluripotent,Embryonic stem cells (ESC),mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Diabetic pregnancy,Reproductive & Pregnancy,"reactive oxygen species, up","Oxidative stress, up",NS,NS,NS

We report that the basal levels of ROS in dispersed rat embryonic cells in vitro, as determined by fluorescence of dichlorofluorescein (DCF), were not different in cells from control and diabetic pregnancy at day 10 or 12. Beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) and succinic acid monomethyl ester both augmented DCF fluorescence in cells from day 12 embryos of normal and diabetic rats but not from day 10 embryos. Cells of day 10 and day 12 embryos from normal and diabetic rats responded to increasing glucose concentrations with a dosage-dependent alleviation of DCF fluorescence. Day 10 embryonic cells exhibited high glucose utilization rates and high pentose phosphate shunt rates, but low mitochondrial oxidation rates. Moreover, in vitro culture of embryos between gestational days 9 and 10 in the presence of 20% oxygen induced an increased and glucose-sensitive oxidation of glucose compared with embryos not cultured in vitro. At gestation day 12, however, pentose phosphate shunt rates showed a decrease, whereas the mitochondrial beta-HB oxidation rates were increased compared with those at gestation day 10. This was paralleled by a lower expression of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase- and phosphofructokinase-mRNA levels at day 12 than at day 10. On the other hand, H-ferritin mRNA expression at day 12 was high compared with day 10. None of the mRNA species investigated were affected by the diabetic state of the mother. It was concluded that beta-HB-induced stimulation of mitochondrial oxidative events may lead to the generation of ROS at gestational day 12, but probably not at day 10, when only a minute amount of mitochondrial activity occurs. Thus our results do not support the notion of diabetes-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress before the development of a placental supply of oxygen.",INS,Large-White SPF pigs; isolated SPF pig islets,animal; in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,pancreatic islets,Pancreas,beta cells,Pancreatic Endocrine,β-cells (islet),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"insulin secretion, up","Insulin secretion, up",ketone body (10 mmol/l),In vitro media supplementation,NS

In this context, we adopted a strategy of islet isolation from pigs raised and killed in specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions as a minimum with regard to the concept of quality assurance. Accordingly, the present study investigated the function of SPF pig islets to determine whether they react qualitatively and quantitatively to nutriments, hormones and neuromediators with which they would be confronted in man and could therefore provide effective regulation during physiologic or physiopathologic situations. beta cells from 18 Large-White SPF pigs were functionally intact after 7 days in culture. Insulin stimulation indexes (SI) of 3.1 +/- 0.2, 2.2 +/- 0.1, and 4.4 +/- 0.3 were found respectively for 30 mmol/l K+, 100 mumol/l tolbutamide and 10 mmol/l theophylline. Basal insulin secretion (72.2 +/- 7.6 muU/min) had already increased significantly (p < 0.001) with 5.5 mmol/l glucose (184.2 +/- 25.5 muU/min, SI: 2.5 +/- 0.6), indicating that the threshold stimulatory concentration was comparable to that of human islets. Insulin secretion increased in a glucose dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001): SI: 3.1 +/- 0.3 and 3.6 +/- 0.2 with 11.0 mmol/l and 22.0 mmol/l glucose, which showed a satisfactory magnitude with reference to human islets. Even the subtle phenomenon of ""glucose memory"" was apparent in these pig islets. Arginine stimulated (p < 0.001) insulin secretion dose-dependently (SI: 2.2 +/- 0.3 with 5 mmol/l and 2.9 +/- 0.2 with 10 mmol/l). The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (10 mmol/l) also induced insulin secretion (SI: 4.3 +/- 0.3). Insulin release was stimulated by 4 mumol/l gastric inhibitory peptide, revealing sensitivity to the hormonal enteroinsular axis, and by 2 mumol/l glucagon. Parasympathetic cholinergic influence was studied using 500 mumol/l carbamylcholine, which increased insulin secretion. The influence of orthosympathetic control and of stress situations was also studied. As in human islet response, epinephrine and the alpha 2-agonist clonidine (50 mumol/l) inhibited insulin secretion. Finally pre-culture of islets may be beneficial for graft outcome, provided that no deterioration in islet function occurs. A prolonged 21-day culture of SPF pig islets showed no decrease in insulin response to glucose, arginine and potassium, even with an unaltered threshold stimulatory glucose concentration. Thus, Large-White SPF pigs and the application of our isolation procedure provided islets with functional characteristics reproducibly compatible with potential utilisation for effective regulation of glycaemia under physiologic and physiopathologic situations in humans.",0,fibroblasts from non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus chronic wounds; fibroblasts from diabetic uninjured skin; fibroblasts from chronic venous stasis ulcers (nondiabetic); fibroblasts from uninjured normal skin,human; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"l-lactate production, up",Metabolic Regulation,skin,Skin/Integument,fibroblasts,Stromal / Mesenchymal,Fibroblasts,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"fibroblast proliferation, down","Cell viability, down",NS,NS,NS
9778588,Inhibited proliferation of fibroblasts derived from chronic diabetic wounds and normal dermal fibroblasts treated with high glucose is associated with increased formation of l-lactate.,"Diabetes is accompanied by delayed wound healing and insufficient granulation tissue formation, possibly because of a defect in fibroblast function. We have previously shown that fibroblasts derived from chronic diabetic foot ulcers have lower proliferation compared with those from uninjured skin. The aim of this study was to investigate possible mechanisms explaining the impaired fibroblast proliferation observed in fibroblasts from non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus chronic wounds and normal fibroblasts cultured in high glucose. Fibroblasts from two groups of patients were studied: nondiabetic patients with chronic venous stasis ulcers and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients with chronic diabetic wounds. Biopsies from both uninjured skin and wounds were taken from the same patients to serve as sources of fibroblasts. A fluorometric method was used to determine DNA content, and a spectrophotometric lactate oxidase method was used for lactate level analysis. We found a dose-dependent inhibition of normal fibroblast proliferation when adding conditioned media from non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus wound fibroblasts. The conditioned medium, from these cells showed elevated l-lactate levels, 6.3 +/- 0.7 mmol/L, compared with media derived from nondiabetic, 2.1 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (p < 0.01), and diabetic uninjured skin fibroblasts, 3.5 +/- 0.6 mmol/L, and from chronic nondiabetic wound fibroblasts 2.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/L. Addition of 6 mmol/L l-lactate to uninjured normal fibroblasts resulted in decreased DNA content (58 +/- 7%, p < 0.01). Previously we have shown that high glucose concentrations inhibit fibroblast proliferation and induce growth factor resistance. When increasing the amount of d-glucose in the media, l-lactate levels increased in all cell types. When the uninjured normal cells were treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate, the total DNA content decreased by 42 +/- 5% (p < 0.05), with no significant increase in the l-lactate levels. These observations indicate that l-lactate production may be of importance for fibroblast proliferation in vitro and may play a role in fibroblast proliferation in vivo.",0,rat brain nerve terminals,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"acetyl-CoA availability, NS",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,nerve terminals,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Cholinergic encephalopathy,Neurodegenerative,"acetylcholine release, NS","Neurotransmitter release, NS",NS,NS,NS

National Institute of Child Health and Development.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess relationships between beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) level and pregnancy outcome in human pregnancy in light of the fact that high levels of beta-OHB cause malformations and growth retardation in in vitro studies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed beta-OHB in prospectively collected specimens from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-Diabetes in Early Pregnancy Study, in gestational weeks 6-12 in diabetic (n = 204-239) and nondiabetic (n = 316-332) pregnant women. RESULTS: Levels of beta-OHB in diabetic women were 2.5-fold higher than in nondiabetic pregnant women at 6 weeks' gestation and declined to 1.6-fold above nondiabetic women by 12 weeks' gestation (P < 0.0001 at all times). beta-OHB was positively correlated with glucose levels (P < 0.0001) in diabetic mothers, probably reflecting degree of diabetic control. beta-OHB correlated inversely with glucose (P < 0.0003) (gestational week 6 only) in nondiabetic mothers, possibly reflecting caloric intake. beta-OHB tended to be lower (not higher) in diabetic and nondiabetic mothers with malformed infants or pregnancy losses, but the difference was not statistically significant. beta-OHB in diabetic mothers at 8, 10, and 12 weeks correlated inversely with birth weight (P = 0.004-0.02), even after adjusting for maternal glucose levels. beta-OHB levels were also generally lower in diabetic mothers of macrosomic infants, and week 12 ultrasound crown-rump measurements were inversely related to beta-OHB levels. CONCLUSIONS: The lst trimester beta-OHB is significantly higher in diabetic than nondiabetic pregnant women. In both groups, beta-OHB tended to be lower, not higher, in mothers who had a malformed infant or pregnancy loss. beta-OHB was inversely related to crown-rump length and birth weight. The modest beta-OHB elevation in the 1st trimester of reasonably well-controlled diabetic pregnancy is not associated with malformations, probably because beta-OHB levels causing malformations in embryo culture models are 20- to 40-fold higher. The mechanism of the beta-OHB association with impaired fetal growth is unknown.",0,rat brain synaptosomes,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"Ca-dependent transport, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,brain,Brain/CNS,synaptosomes,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

The mechanism by which ketosis causes accelerated cellular damage and vascular disease in diabetes is not known. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that elevated levels of ketone bodies increase lipid peroxidation in endothelial cells. Human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured for 24 h at 37 degrees C with ketone bodies (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate). Acetoacetate, but not beta-hydroxybutyrate, caused an increase in lipid peroxidation and growth inhibition in cultured HUVEC. To determine whether ketone bodies generate oxygen radicals, studies using cell-free buffered solution were performed. They showed a significant superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitable reduction of cytochrome C by acetoacetate, but not by beta-hydroxybutyrate, suggesting the generation of superoxide anion radicals by acetoacetate. Additional studies show that Fe2+ potentiates oxygen radical generation by acetoacetate. Thus, elevated levels of ketone body acetoacetate can generate oxygen radicals and cause lipid peroxidation in endothelial cells, providing a possible mechanism for the increased incidence of vascular disease in diabetes.",0,patients with type 2 diabetes; age- and weight-matched nondiabetic control subjects,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Multi-model,"beta-cell lipid blindness, down",Metabolic Regulation,adipose tissue,Adipose tissue,beta-cell,Pancreatic Endocrine,β-cells (islet),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Type 2 diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"insulin secretion, down","Insulin secretion, down",plasma,NS,NS

To this end, basal insulin secretion rates (ISR) in response to acute increases in plasma FFAs were evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes and in age- and weight-matched nondiabetic control subjects during 1) intravenous infusion of lipid plus heparin (L/H), which stimulated intravascular lipolysis, and 2) the FFA rebound, which followed lowering of plasma FFAs with nicotinic acid (NA) and was a consequence of increased lipolysis from the subject's own adipose tissue. At comparable euglycemia, diabetic patients had similar ISR but higher plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) levels during L/H infusion and higher plasma FFA and beta-OHB levels during the FFA rebound than nondiabetic control subjects. Correlating ISR with plasma FFA plus beta-OHB levels showed that in response to the same changes in FFA plus beta-OHB levels, diabetic patients secreted approximately 30% less insulin than nondiabetic control subjects. In addition, twice as much insulin was secreted during L/H infusion as during the FFA rebound in response to the same FFA/beta-OHB stimulation by both diabetic patients and control subjects. Glycerol, which was present in the infused lipid (272 mmol/l) did not affect ISR. We concluded that 1) assessment of FFA effects on ISR requires consideration of effects on ISR by ketone bodies; 2) ISR responses to FFA/beta-OHB were defective in patients with type 2 diabetes (partial beta-cell lipid blindness), but this defect was compensated by elevated plasma levels of FFAs and ketone bodies; and 3) approximately two times more insulin was released per unit change in plasma FFA plus beta-OHB during L/H infusion than during the FFA rebound after NA.

This effect is mediated by a process involving enforced mitochondrial calcium accumulation in the absence of discernible elevation in the cytosolic concentration of free calcium ions. We now show that the intracellular source of the cation is a ryanodine-sensitive calcium store.

10432173,Myocardial glucose uptake measured with fluorodeoxyglucose: a proposed method to account for variable lumped constants.,"Quantitative assessment of myocardial glucose uptake by the glucose tracer analog 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) depends on a correction factor (lumped constant [LC]), which may vary. We propose that this variability is caused by different affinities of FDG and glucose for membrane transport and phosphorylation and can be predicted from the time course of FDG retention. We therefore measured the LC under steady-state metabolic conditions and compared the results with values predicted from the tracer retention alone. METHODS: We measured rates of myocardial glucose uptake by tracer ([2-3H]glucose) and tracer analog methods (FDG) in isolated working Sprague-Dawley rat hearts perfused with Krebs buffer and glucose, or glucose plus insulin or beta-hydroxybutyrate. In separate experiments, we established the theoretical upper and lower limits for the LC (Rt and Rp), which are determined by the relative rates of FDG and glucose membrane transport (Rt, 1.73 +/- 0.22) and the relative rates of FDG and glucose phosphorylation (Rp, 0.15 +/- 0.04). RESULTS: The LC was decreased in the presence of insulin or beta-hydroxybutyrate or both (from 1.14 +/- 0.3 to 0.58 +/- 0.16 [insulin], to 0.75 +/- 0.17 [beta-hydroxybutyrate] or to 0.53 +/- 0.17 [both], P < 0.05). The time-activity curves of FDG retention reflected these changes. Combining the upper and lower limits for the LC with the ratio between unidirectional and steady-state FDG uptake rates allowed the prediction of individual LCs, which agreed well with the actually measured values (r = 0.96, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The LC is not a constant but is a predictable quotient. As a result of the fixed relation between tracer and tracee for both membrane transport and phosphorylation, the quotient can be determined from the FDG time-activity curve and true rates of myocardial glucose uptake can be measured.",VEGFA,mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (MBMEC),animal; in vitro,Multi-model,"VPF/VEGF production, up",Vascular Function & Angiogenesis,brain,Brain/CNS,mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (MBMEC),Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
10480618,Acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate differentially regulate endothelin-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells.,"Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), is characterized by a lack of insulin production from beta cells in the pancreas. One of the metabolic consequences of this insulin deficit is an increased hepatic synthesis of ketone bodies, resulting in a serious medical complication, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA, in turn, has been associated with the development of cerebral edema. The severity of this complication ranges from death to a subclinical presentation, but seems to be invariably present to some degree. The etiology of the cerebral edema is unknown, but changes in osmolality, pH, and insulin effects on the blood-brain barrier have all been suggested as possible culprits. Blood-brain barrier impermeability is maintained by the endothelial cells (EC) lining the blood vessels. Thus, it would seem likely that alterations in EC function would be necessary for the development of cerebral edema. However, no studies have examined the effects of ketone bodies on brain endothelial cells. The two major ketone bodies in DKA are acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB). In the present study we examined the effect of these ketone bodies on a major intracellular signalling pathway. The changes in intracellular calcium concentration, and the production of two vasoactive peptides, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and vascular permeability factor (VPF/VEGF) in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (MBMEC). The present studies demonstrate the BOHB can increase vascular permeability factor. In contrast, AcAc increases the production of the potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1. This data would suggest that brain ECs are potential targets of the metabolic alterations in DKA.",0,normal RBCs; cell-free buffer solution; hyperketonemic diabetic patients; normoketonemic type 1 diabetic patients; age-matched normal subjects,human; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells; NS; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"lipid peroxidation, no-change",Multiple mechanisms,RBCs,NS,RBCs,Blood (non-nucleated),Erythrocytes / Reticulocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
10568508,Hyperketonemia can increase lipid peroxidation and lower glutathione levels in human erythrocytes in vitro and in type 1 diabetic patients.,"Recent studies have suggested that elevated cellular lipid peroxidation may play a role in the development of cellular dysfunction and other complications of diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes frequently encounter elevated levels of the ketone bodies acetoacetate (AA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and acetone (ACE). This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that ketosis might increase lipid peroxidation and lower glutathione (GSH) levels of red blood cells (RBCs) in diabetic patients. This study demonstrates that incubation of AA with normal RBCs in phosphate-buffered saline (37 degrees C for 24 h) resulted in marked GSH depletion, oxidized glutathione accumulation, hydroxyl radical generation, and increased membrane lipid peroxidation. Increases in oxygen radicals and lipid peroxidation and depletion of GSH in RBCs were not observed with BHB or ACE treatments. Similarly, there was a significant generation of superoxide ion radicals even in a cell-free buffer solution of AA, but not in that of BHB. The presence of BHB together with AA did not influence the capacity of AA to generate oxygen radicals in a cell-free solution or the increase in lipid peroxidation of RBCs incubated with AA. The antioxidants vitamin E and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) blocked increase in lipid peroxidation in AA-treated RBCs. To examine the effects of ketone bodies in vivo, studies were performed that showed a significant decrease in GSH and an increase in lipid peroxidation levels in RBCs of hyperketonemic diabetic patients, but not in normoketonemic type 1 diabetic patients, when compared with age-matched normal subjects. This study demonstrates that elevated levels of the ketone body AA can increase lipid peroxidation and lower GSH levels of RBCs in people with type 1 diabetes.",0,rat forebrain mitochondria,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"NADPH regeneration, up",Metabolic Regulation,forebrain,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
10668691,The regeneration of reduced glutathione in rat forebrain mitochondria identifies metabolic pathways providing the NADPH required.,"Metabolic pathways underlying the regeneration of reduced glutathione were investigated in acutely isolated metabolically active mitochondria from rat forebrain. The application of hydrogen peroxide to the organelles was accompanied by a transient increase in glutathione disulfide. The recovery of reduced glutathione was significantly improved in the presence of alternatively succinate, malate, citrate, isocitrate, or beta-hydroxybutyrate. Inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase by malonate abolished the beneficial effect of succinate on the reduction of glutathione disulfide but did not influence the effect of isocitrate. Fluorocitrate, an inhibitor of aconitase, blocked the effect exerted by citrate but did not inhibit the effects of malate or beta-hydroxybutyrate. Uncoupling of the respiratory chain by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone prevented the beneficial effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate but did not abolish the improved reduction of mitochondrial glutathione disulfide in the presence of malate and isocitrate. These results suggest that NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase as well as malic enzyme and nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase contribute to the regeneration of NADPH required for the reduction of glutathione disulfide in brain mitochondria.",0,rat hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slices; cultured hippocampal neurons,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells,"direct effect on voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels, no-change",Ion & Nutrient Transport,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,hippocampal neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

BACKGROUND: The ketogenic diet is presumed to be an effective anticonvulsant regimen for some children with medically intractable seizures. However, its mechanism of action remains a mystery. According to one hypothesis, ketone bodies have anticonvulsant properties. METHODS: The authors examined the effect of betaHB and AA on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slices and cultured hippocampal neurons. In cultured neurons, their effect was also directly assayed on postsynaptic receptor properties. Finally, their ability to prevent spontaneous seizures was determined in a hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slice model. RESULTS: betaHB and AA did not alter synaptic transmission in these models. CONCLUSIONS: The anticonvulsant properties of the ketogenic diet do not result from a direct effect of ketone bodies on the primary voltage and ligand gated ion channels mediating excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission in the hippocampus.",0,Male Wistar rat pups,animal,Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"anticonvulsant effect, no-change; proconvulsant effect, up","Seizure protection, no-change; Seizure activity, up",ketogenic diet containing medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil,MCT / Medium-chain fats,NS

After 10 days on the diets, they were subjected to one of four seizure tests-maximal electric shock, threshold electroconvulsive shock, threshold pentylenetetrazol, or maximal pentylenetetrazol. After testing, subjects were sacrificed and blood samples were analyzed for beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration. It was found that the MCT diet produced blood levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate that were comparable to or higher than those commonly reported in clinical studies. However, no anticonvulsant effects were seen in any of the seizure tests. In fact, the tests involving maximal seizures actually showed proconvulsant effects. It appears that clinical levels of ketones may be present in the bloodstream without suppressing seizures.",0,primary confluent cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from canine femoral artery; freshly dispersed VSMC from canine femoral artery,animal; in vitro,Multi-model; Animal – Other Mammal,"lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (LPR), up",Metabolic Regulation,vascular smooth muscle (canine femoral artery),Vasculature,vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC),Muscle – Smooth / Perivascular,Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan","reducing substrate, beta-hydroxybutyrate",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
10790159,Insulin increases NO-stimulated guanylate cyclase activity in cultured VSMC while raising redox potential.,"Insulin acutely stimulates cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production in primary confluent cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from canine femoral artery, but the mechanism is not known. These cells contain the inducible isoform of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS), and insulin-stimulated cGMP production in confluent cultured cells is blocked by the NOS inhibitor, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). In the present study, it is shown that iNOS is also present in freshly dispersed VSMC from this artery, indicating that iNOS expression in cultured VSMC is not an artifact of the culture process. Insulin did not stimulate NOS activity in primary confluent cultured cells because it did not affect citrulline or combined NO(-)(3)/NO(-)(2) production. To see whether insulin required the permissive presence of NO to stimulate cGMP production, iNOS and basal cGMP production were inhibited with L-NMMA, and the cells were incubated with or without 1 nM insulin and/or the NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine (SNAP) at a concentration (0.1 microM) that restored cGMP production to the basal value. In the presence of L-NMMA, insulin no longer affected cGMP production but when insulin was added to L-NMMA plus SNAP, cGMP production was increased by 69% (P < 0.05 vs. L-NMMA plus SNAP). Insulin, which increases glucose uptake by these cells, increased the cell lactate content and the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (LPR) by 81 and 97%, respectively (both P < 0.05), indicating that the hormone increased aerobic glycolysis and the redox potential. The effects of insulin on LPR and cGMP production were blocked by removing glucose or by adding 2-deoxyglucose to the incubation media and were duplicated by the reducing substrate, beta-hydroxybutyrate. We conclude that insulin does not acutely affect iNOS activity in these VSMC but it does augment cGMP production induced by the NO already present in the cell while increasing aerobic glycolysis and the cell redox potential.",ICA1; 0,cat atrial myocytes; cat ventricular myocytes,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"glycolytic flux, down",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,cardiac myocytes,Muscle – Skeletal,Skeletal myocytes / myotubes,sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR),Endoplasmic Reticulum,Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR),nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
10805800,Functional coupling between glycolysis and excitation-contraction coupling underlies alternans in cat heart cells.,"Electromechanical alternans was characterized in single cat atrial and ventricular myocytes by simultaneous measurements of action potentials, membrane current, cell shortening and changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Using laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy, alternans of electrically evoked [Ca2+]i transients revealed marked differences between atrial and ventricular myocytes. In ventricular myocytes, electrically evoked [Ca2+]i transients during alternans were spatially homogeneous. In atrial cells Ca2+ release started at subsarcolemmal peripheral regions and subsequently spread toward the centre of the myocyte. In contrast to ventricular myocytes, in atrial cells propagation of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during the small-amplitude [Ca2+]i transient was incomplete, leading to failures of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in central regions of the cell. The mechanism underlying alternans was explored by evaluating the trigger signal for SR Ca2+ release (voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ current, ICa,L) and SR Ca2+ load during alternans. Voltage-clamp experiments revealed that peak ICa,L was not affected during alternans when measured simultaneously with changes of cell shortening. The SR Ca2+ content, evaluated by application of caffeine pulses, was identical following the small-amplitude and the large-amplitude [Ca2+]i transient. These results suggest that the primary mechanism responsible for cardiac alternans does not reside in the trigger signal for Ca2+ release and SR Ca2+ load. beta-Adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol (isoprenaline) reversed electromechanical alternans, suggesting that under conditions of positive cardiac inotropy and enhanced efficiency of EC coupling alternans is less likely to occur. The occurrence of electromechanical alternans could be elicited by impairment of glycolysis. Inhibition of glycolytic flux by application of pyruvate, iodoacetate or beta-hydroxybutyrate induced electromechanical and [Ca2+]i transient alternans in both atrial and ventricular myocytes. The data support the conclusion that in cardiac myocytes alternans is the result of periodic alterations in the gain of EC coupling, i. e. the efficacy of a given trigger signal to release Ca2+ from the SR. It is suggested that the efficiency of EC coupling is locally controlled in the microenvironment of the SR Ca2+ release sites by mechanisms utilizing ATP, produced by glycolytic enzymes closely associated with the release channel.",0,cultured mesencephalic neurons; hippocampal neurons,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"mitochondrial energy generation, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,brain,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Parkinson's disease; Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"neuronal survival, up","Survival, up",4 mM d-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

Similarly, a fragment of amyloid protein, Abeta(1-42), is lethal to hippocampal cells, producing recent memory deficits characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that addition of 4 mM d-beta-hydroxybutyrate protected cultured mesencephalic neurons from MPP(+) toxicity and hippocampal neurons from Abeta(1-42) toxicity. Our previous work in heart showed that ketone bodies, normal metabolites, can correct defects in mitochondrial energy generation. The ability of ketone bodies to protect neurons in culture suggests that defects in mitochondrial energy generation contribute to the pathophysiology of both brain diseases. These findings further suggest that ketone bodies may play a therapeutic role in these most common forms of human neurodegeneration.",0,COS cells; transgenic mice with targeted neuronal expression of ABAD,in vitro; animal,In vitro – Immortalized cell line; Animal – Mouse,"oxidation by ABAD, NS",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,COS cells,Unspecified / Mixed,Cell line (origin unclear),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cellular energy charge, up","Cellular energy charge, up",d-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

In view of the wide substrate specificity of ABAD and its high activity on l-beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA derivatives, we asked whether it might also catalyze the oxidation of the ketone body d-3-hydroxybutyrate. This was indeed the case, and oxidation proceeded with K(m) of approximately 4.5 mm and V(max) of approximately 4 nmol/min/mg protein. When placed in medium with d-beta-hydroxybutyrate as the principal energy substrate, COS cells stably transfected to overexpress wild-type ABAD (COS/wtABAD) better maintained 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide reduction, cellular energy charge, and morphologic phenotype compared with COS/vector cells. Using a severe model of metabolic perturbation, transgenic mice with targeted neuronal expression of ABAD subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion showed strokes of smaller volume and lower neurologic deficit scores in parallel with increased brain ATP and decreased lactate, compared with nontransgenic controls.

The exact mechanism of this neuroprotection is still unknown. This study used 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to monitor energy metabolism during a 3-h episode of HI in 7-d-old rat pups in one of two groups. The first group was pretreated with 0.1 mL saline (i.p.) and the second group was treated with 0.1 mL of 0.1mg/kg DEX (i.p.) 22 h before HI. Animals pretreated with DEX had elevated nucleoside triphosphate and phosphocreatine levels during HI when compared with controls. Saline-treated animals had significant decreases in nucleoside triphosphate and phosphocreatine and increases in inorganic phosphate over this same period. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance data unequivocally demonstrate preservation of energy metabolism during HI in neonatal rats pretreated with DEX. Animals pretreated with DEX had little or no brain damage following 3 h of HI when compared with matched controls, which experienced severe neuronal loss and cortical infarction. These same pretreated animals had an increase in blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels before ischemia, suggesting an increase in ketone bodies, which is the neonate's primary energy source.

Phosphocreatine levels decreased with 2-deoxy-D-glucose administration but not with rapid pacing. Respiration increased to meet the increased ATP demand at 30 degrees C. The data suggest that 1) when NADH(m) is decreased during rapid pacing with defined substrates, the amplitude of contraction is decreased; 2) the amplitude of contraction during electrical pacing does not change with rate of pacing when both the ATP and NADH(m) levels are continuously replenished; and 3) the replenishment of NADH(m) during pacing with physiological substrates may be rate-limited by substrate supply to mitochondrial dehydrogenases.

On day 12 of life, the pups were weighed and decapitated. The intake of 10% and 20% ethanol solutions by the lactating rats decreased the pups' body weight and liver weight. The pups' liver ATP-citrate lyase activity was decreased in all ethanol groups. The pups' brain weight decreased in E20 only. Glucose metabolism and lactate production were studied in the pups' brain slices, which were incubated at 37 degrees C in Krebs-Henseleit buffer under carbogen in the presence of glucose (5 mM) plus 14C-glucose (0.04 microCi) with or without beta-hydroxybutyrate or insulin. Study of the incubated pups' brain slices showed that the intake of the 20% ethanol solution by the dams increased glucose consumption, oxidation, lactate production, and lipogenesis rate from glucose in all media studied, as compared with findings in the C group. In the pups' brain slices, the lactate production and lipogenesis rate from glucose were higher in E10 than in the C group. The addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate to the incubation medium caused a decrease in glucose oxidation in C, E5, and E20 and an increase in glucose consumption in E10. Ingestion of the 5% ethanol solution by dams decreased the pups' brain lipogenesis rate from glucose in all media studied. We concluded that the effects of maternal alcohol intake on the pups' development and metabolism are dose-dependent. High amounts of ethanol intake (10% or 20%) caused a great impairment in the pups' growth, as well as their liver and brain metabolism.

Hearts from 7-wk streptozotocin diabetic and control rats, perfused with buffer containing 11 mM glucose, with or without 1.2 mM palmitate or the ketone bodies, 4 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate plus 1 mM acetoacetate, were subjected to 32 min of low-flow (0.3 ml x g wet wt(-1) x min(-1)) ischemia, followed by 32 min of reperfusion. In control rat hearts, neither palmitate nor ketone bodies altered the recovery of contractile function. Diabetic rat hearts perfused with glucose alone or with ketone bodies, had functional recoveries 50% lower than those of the control hearts, but palmitate restored recovery to control levels. In a parallel group with the functional recoveries, palmitate prevented the 54% faster loss of ATP in the diabetic, glucose-perfused rat hearts during ischemia, but had no effect on the rate of ATP depletion in control hearts. Palmitate decreased total glucose uptake in control rat hearts during low-flow ischemia, from 106 +/- 17 to 52 +/- 12 micromol/g wet wt, but did not alter the total glucose uptake in the diabetic rat hearts, which was 42 +/- 5 micromol/g wet wt.

Seventy-four children on the ketogenic diet presenting for routine follow-up visits had blood levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate correlated with their seizure control. Forty-two children admitted for initiation of the ketogenic diet had urine ketones measured by dipstick and correlated with simultaneous blood levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels statistically correlated with seizure control (P = .003). Children with blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels greater than 4 mmol/L were significantly more likely to have a decrease in seizure frequency than those with levels less than 4 mmol/L. Urine ketones of 4+ (160 mmol/L) were found on dipstick when blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels exceeded 2 mmol/L. Seizure control correlates with blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels and is more likely when blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels are greater than 4 mmo/L. The traditional measurement of urine ketones by dipsticks in children on the ketogenic diet provides a less than optimal assessment of the degree of blood ketosis. Three to four plus (80-160 mmol/L) urine ketones are necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, to achieve optimal seizure control in children on the ketogenic diet.

The deleterious effect of hyperglycemia and altered oxidative substrate availability on the diabetic brain is the subject of many studies. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of the altered metabolic environment, namely, hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia, on glucose metabolism in the diabetic brain. More specifically, we examined the effect of diabetes on the glucose flux via the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) pathways and subsequent metabolism in the tricarboxylic acid cycles in neurons and glia. To this end, [U-(13)C]glucose was infused into the circulation of alloxan-induced diabetic young adult rabbits, and the [(13)C]glucose metabolites were subsequently studied in brain extracts by (13)C-NMR. Significantly elevated brain glucose levels were found. In the hyperketonemic rabbits, elevated cerebral levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HBA) were found. Alterations in the labeling patterns of glutamine in the hyperketonemic group lead to the conclusion that the elevated beta-HBA levels inhibit glucose metabolism, mostly in glia. This results in accumulation of glucose in the diabetic brain. In addition, altered levels of glutamine, glutamate, and GABA were also attributed to the effect of beta-HBA on brain metabolism.

The protective effect of alternative energy substrates, such as pyruvate, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate against PDC-induced neuronal death during 3-NP exposure was studied and compared to the effects of the antioxidant vitamin E, the spin trapper alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN), voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonists, and glutamate receptor antagonists. Results show that neuronal damage can be efficiently prevented in the presence of pyruvate and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801, whereas the non-NMDA receptor antagonist NBQX, acetoacetate, vitamin E, and PBN showed partial protection. In contrast, beta-hydroxybutyrate and voltage-dependent calcium channels blockers did not show any protective effect at the concentrations tested.",0,chicks,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"inhibitory signal, down",Other / Unspecified,central and peripheral nervous systems,Multi-tissue,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"food intake, down","Food intake, down",central and peripheral injection,Multi-source,NS
11548795,Influence of ketone body and the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation on the food intake of the chick.,"1. Fatty acid oxidation is known to be involved in the control of food intake in mammals. The effect of fatty acid oxidation on food intake in chickens was studied using a ketone body (beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB)) and mercaptoacetate (MA) (an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation). 2. Central and peripheral injection of beta-HB decreased food intake in a dose-dependent manner, while low doses of MA had no effect. Higher doses of MA inhibited feeding but also caused mortality. 3. These results indicate that ketone bodies act as an inhibitory signal for food intake in both the central and peripheral nervous systems but that inhibition of fatty acid oxidation may not be associated with feeding behaviour in chicks.",BAX; BCL2; PARP1; ICAM1,Male Sprague Dawley rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"expression of cellular injury markers, down",Cell Death & Survival,lung,Lung,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Pulmonary cellular injury,Respiratory,"pulmonary apoptosis, down","Apoptosis, down",Ketone Ringer's (containing 28 mEq/L of beta-hydroxybutyrate),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

We hypothesized that the use of energy substrates, such as ketone bodies, in the resuscitation fluids would protect against this injury. As markers of cellular injury we measured the induction of apoptotic cell death and the expression of Intracellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1). STUDY DESIGN: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 35) under inhaled isoflurane anesthesia had placement of femoral arterial and venous catheters. A three-stage hemorrhage model was used for this experiment. There was an initial hemorrhage of 27 mL/kg for 10 minutes. During the next 75 minutes another 8 mL/kg of blood was withdrawn at a steady rate. The resuscitation fluids were then infused for 45 minutes during which the third continuous hemorrhage of 8 mL/kg was performed. The animals were randomized to five groups: 1) sham hemorrhage (n = 6); 2) sham resuscitation (n = 7); 3) Lactated Ringer's resuscitation, three times the volume of shed blood (n = 8); 4) Ketone Ringer's (containing 28 mEq/L of beta-hydroxybutyrate) resuscitation, three times the volume of shed blood (n = 7); and 5) plasma resuscitation, volume equal to shed blood (n = 7). The animals were sacrificed 1 hour after resuscitation and lungs were harvested. Western blot technique was used for the determination of proapoptotic protein (bax), antiapoptotic protein (bcl-2), apoptotic fragments of poly ADP-ribose polymerase, and ICAM-1. Sections of lung were also subjected to immunostaining using antibodies to bax and ICAM-1 proteins (reported as number of positive cells/mm2). RESULTS: Lactated Ringer's resuscitation caused a significant increase in pulmonary apoptosis and ICAM-1 expression compared with the sham hemorrhage group. Animals resuscitated with Ketone Ringer's solution and plasma did not show this injury pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of lactate with ketone bodies in the resuscitation fluid attenuates the expression of cellular injury markers in the lung.",0,rat; striatum; hippocampus,animal,Animal – Rat; NS,"glutamate uptake, down",Ion & Nutrient Transport,striatum,Brain/CNS,neuron,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Ischemic neuronal death,Neurodegenerative,"neuronal death, no-change","Neuronal survival, no-change",NS,NS,NS
11700013,Neurotoxicity of glutamate uptake inhibition in vivo: correlation with succinate dehydrogenase activity and prevention by energy substrates.,"Impairment of glutamate uptake or the reverse action of its transporters has been suggested as the mechanism responsible for the increased glutamate extracellular levels associated with ischemic neuronal damage. In previous studies we have shown that glutamate uptake inhibition by L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (PDC) in the rat striatum and hippocampus in vivo does not induce neuronal death despite the notable increase in the extracellular levels of glutamate and aspartate. However, PDC intracerebral administration leads to neuronal death in rats chronically injected with the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). In the present study we have determined the time course of inhibition of SDH activity in the striatum of rats acutely injected with a single dose of 3-NP (20 mg/kg), and studied its relation to PDC neurotoxicity. PDC induced larger lesions when administered during maximum inhibition of SDH activity while smaller lesions were found when it was injected during recovery of enzyme activity. We also studied the neuroprotective effect of different energy substrates such as creatine, pyruvate, and the ketone bodies beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate in this experimental model. Our results show partial protection with all compounds except for beta-hydroxybutyrate that showed no protection, while MK-801 completely prevented PDC-induced neuronal damage. We believe that the present results might be of relevance for the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for ischemic neuronal death and its prevention.",0,bilateral carotid artery ligation; hypoxia; anoxia; ischemia,animal,Animal – Other Mammal; NS,"ATP levels, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Cerebral hypoxia; Anoxia; Ischemia,Injury & Trauma; Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"cerebral water content, down; sodium content, down; ATP level, up; lactate level, down","Brain injury, down; Sodium content, down; ATP level, up; Lactate, down",isotonic solution,NS,NS

Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is one of the ketone bodies that can be utilized as an energy source during starvation. The purpose of our study was to define the protective effects of BHB on brain damage induced by hypoxia, anoxia and ischemia. The isotonic solution of BHB administered 30 min before the induction of ischemia at doses over 50 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) showed remarkable protective effects against hypoxia and anoxia. BHB administered immediately after a bilateral carotid artery ligation at a dose of 30 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) significantly suppressed the elevation of cerebral water and sodium contents as well as maintaining high ATP and low lactate levels. In contrast, glycerin, a hypertonic agent, substantially reduced the water content but did not show any significant effect on other parameters.

11911577,Chronic exposure to beta-hydroxybutyrate impairs insulin action in primary cultures of adult cardiomyocytes.,"Type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients often show elevated plasma ketone body concentrations. Because ketone bodies compete with other energetic substrates and reduce their utilization, they could participate in the development of insulin resistance in the heart. We have examined the effect of elevated levels of ketone bodies on insulin action in primary cultures of adult cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes were cultured with the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) for 4 or 16 h, and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was evaluated. Although short-term exposure to ketone bodies was not associated with any change in insulin action, our data demonstrated that preincubation with beta-OHB for 16 h markedly reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes. This effect is concentration dependent and persists for at least 6 h after the removal of beta-OHB from the media. Ketone bodies also decreased the stimulatory effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and pervanadate on glucose uptake. This diminution could not be explained by a change in either GLUT-1 or GLUT-4 protein content in cardiomyocytes. Chronic exposure to beta-OHB was associated with impaired protein kinase B activation in response to insulin and pervanadate. These results indicate that prolonged exposure to ketone bodies altered insulin action in cardiomyocytes and suggest that this substrate could play a role in the development of insulin resistance in the heart.",IGHM; 0,Sardinian ewes; mononuclear cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal; In vitro – Primary cells,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,mononuclear cells,Unspecified / Mixed,Mixed cell population,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Ketosis,Metabolic & Endocrine,"immunoresponsiveness, no-change","Recognition memory, no-change",BHBA,NS,NS

ANIMALS: 6 Sardinian ewes. PROCEDURE: Mononuclear cells were cultured with concentrations of NEFA (0, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 micromol/L) and BHBA (0, 0.45, 0.9, 1.8, or 3.6 mmol/L). Concentrations of NEFA and BHBA were intended to mimic those of ketotic or healthy ewes, and NEFA and BHBA were tested alone and in combination. Synthesis of DNA was stimulated by use of concanavalin A (Con A) or pokeweed-mitogen (PWM). Secretion of IgM was stimulated by use of PWM. RESULTS: Synthesis of DNA stimulated by Con A and PWM was significantly inhibited by high concentrations of NEFA (> or = 250 micromol/L) or by a combination of high concentrations of NEFA (> or = 250 micromol/L) and all concentrations of BHBA (> or = 0.45 mmol/L). In contrast, DNA synthesis was not inhibited by low concentrations of NEFA (< or = 125 micromol/L) or by a combination of low concentrations of NEFA (< or = 125 micromol/L) and the lowest concentration of BHBA (0.45 mmol/L). Secretion of IgM was significantly inhibited by all concentrations of NEFA and by all combinations of NEFA and BHBA concentrations. When used alone, none of the concentrations of BHBA inhibited DNA synthesis or IgM secretion. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Reduced immunoresponsiveness during ketosis is likely to be associated with an increase in plasma concentration of NEFA and not with an increase in plasma concentration of BH BA.",0,Frings audiogenic seizure-susceptible mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"anticonvulsant activity, no-change",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"seizure occurrence, no-change","Seizure activity, no-change",D-(-)- and L-(+)-isomers,NS,racemic

RESULTS: We found that these ketone bodies, with the exception of the D-(-)-isomer of BHB, were anticonvulsant in this model. Furthermore, with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we confirmed that the activity of L-(+)-BHB was due to dibenzylamine, a chemical contaminant.

Therefore, we examined the effects of glucose overload and hyperketonemia on glucose metabolism in the diabetic fetal brain; more specifically, the effect of diabetes on the glucose flux via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and subsequent metabolism in the fetal cerebral tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were examined, as well as the effect of diabetes on energy fuel utilization in the neurons and glia. Diabetes was induced in pregnant rabbits, and towards term, [U-(13)C(6)]glucose was infused into maternal circulation, and [(13)C]glucose metabolites were subsequently studied in fetal brain extracts by (13)C MRS isotopomer analysis. Significantly elevated maternal and fetal plasma glucose levels (three- and up to fivefold, respectively) and fetal brain glucose levels (up to eightfold) accompanied by an increase of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HBA) levels (approximately 20-fold) were found in the hyperketonemic diabetic animals, whereas fetal cerebral lactate levels were decreased. Alterations in the (13)C labeling patterns, mainly of glutamine, led us to suggest that the entry of beta-HBA-derived acetyl-CoA inhibits formation and entry of labeled glucose-derived acetyl-CoA into the TCA cycle, mainly in glia. Accumulation of glucose and the decrease in lactate levels in the fetal brain are most likely the result of an inhibitory effect of beta-HBA on glycolysis. In addition, loss of (13)C enrichment of TCA cycle intermediates and products, glutamate and glutamine, in the hyperketonemic diabetic fetal brain may be attributed to the effect of beta-HBA fuel utilization by the fetal brain.",0,nondiabetic subjects; insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"ketone body utilization, up",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Type 1 diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"cerebral ketone body utilization, up","Ketone utilization, up",R-beta-[1-(11)C]hydroxybutyrate; unlabeled R-beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion,NS; Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

An infusion of unlabeled R-beta-hydroxybutyrate was started 1 h before the bolus injection of R-beta-[1-(11)C]hydroxybutyrate. The time course of the radioactivity in the brain was measured during 10 min. For both groups, the utilization rate of ketone bodies was found to increase nearly proportionally with the plasma concentration of ketone bodies (1.0 +/- 0.3 micromol/ml for nondiabetic subjects and 1.3 +/- 0.3 micromol/ml for IDDM patients). No transport of ketone bodies from the brain could be detected. This result, together with a recent study of the tissue concentration of R-beta-hydroxybutyrate in the brain by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, indicate that, also at acute hyperketonemia, the rate-limiting step for ketone body utilization is the transport into the brain. No significant difference in transport and utilization of ketone bodies could be detected between the nondiabetic subjects and the IDDM patients.",0,Young (day 23) Sprague-Dawley rats; ad libitum (AL); calorie-restricted normal rodent chow (CR); calorie-restricted ketogenic diet (KD)-fed,animal,Animal – Rat; NS; Human – Interventional,"fatty acid oxidation inhibition, down",Metabolic Regulation,plasma,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"latency to PTZ-induced seizures, down","Seizure activity, down",NS,NS,NS

Young (day 23) Sprague-Dawley rats were fasted for 8 h and then fed their respective diets for 21 days.

Two hours later, all rats received pentylenetetrazole (PTZ; 10 mg/kg; i.p.) every 10 min until seizure onset. Results demonstrated that KD-fed rats had the longest (P<0.05) latency to PTZ-induced seizures. KD-fed rats administered an acute dose of MA had lower (P<0.01) levels of beta hydroxybutyrate in plasma and shorter latency to PTZ-induced seizures compared with control KD-fed rats. However, there was not a significant positive correlation (P>0.10) between plasma beta hydroxybutyrate and latency to seizure, suggesting that beta hydroxybutyrate may be indirectly involved in the antiseizure effects of the KD. Fatty acid oxidation inhibition represents an experimental manipulation that may allow for more precise establishment and evaluation of levels of beta hydroxybutyrate in plasma necessary for antiseizure effects of the KD.",0,rats; permanent middle cerebral artery (p-MCA) occlusion; transient middle cerebral artery (t-MCA) occlusion; hypoxia; anoxia; global cerebral ischemia,animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Other Mammal; NS,"cerebral energy metabolism, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Ischemic stroke,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"infarct area, down","Infarct size, down",BHB (30 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) was continuously administered through the femoral vein),Intravenous BHB,NS

In this study, the cerebroprotective effect of BHB was examined in rats with permanent (p)-occlusion and transient (t)-occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCA). BHB (30 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) was continuously administered through the femoral vein.

In rats with 2-h t-MCA occlusion followed by 22-h reperfusion, BHB significantly reduced cerebral infarct area, edema formation, lipid peroxidation and neurological deficits. Moreover, in the t-MCA occlusion model, delayed administration of BHB started at 1 h after the initiation of the MCA occlusion also significantly reduced cerebral infarct area. Taking together the results obtained in our previous study into account, these results indicate that BHB decreased cerebral edema formation and infarct area by improving of the cerebral energy metabolism during ischemia and by inhibition of lipid peroxidation after reperfusion.",0,adult male Wistar rats; global ischemia by occlusion of the two carotid arteries for 1 hr; reperfusion for 1 hr,animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Other Mammal; NS,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,brain,Brain/CNS,erythrocytes,Blood (non-nucleated),Erythrocytes / Reticulocytes,cytosolic fraction,Cytosol,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
12381528,Effect of melatonin and nifedipine on some antioxidant enzymes and different energy fuels in the blood and brain of global ischemic rats.,"The brain normally derives most of its energy from the aerobic oxidation of glucose and therefore it must be nourished with a rich supply of both glucose and oxygen. Interference with the blood supply, such as in ischemia, could shift the brain to search for another source of energy and to spare its own glucose. Ischemia results not only in energy fuel disturbance, but also in free radical formation and Ca(2+) homeostasis disruption. Therefore, our investigations studied the influence of ischemia on energy fuels, on some natural free radical scavengers, and the relationship between the changes of these parameters in brain and blood. Each of these was also studied under the influence of melatonin, a well-known free radical scavenger, and nifedipine, a Ca(2+)-channel blocker and antioxidant, during ischemia followed by reperfusion (I/R). Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to global ischemia by occlusion of the two carotid arteries for 1 hr (group I), followed by reperfusion for another hour in group II. Drugs were injected after ischemia (group I), and before or after reperfusion onset in the second group. Two series of animals were used. In the first series the effect of the two drugs on the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was investigated in the cytosolic fraction of four brain areas, viz., cortex (CC), thalamus/hypothalamus (T/TH), midbrain (MB) and medulla, pons and cerebellum (MPC). Moreover, the level of both SOD and GR in the erythocytes of these rats was also estimated. In the second series, we studied the effect of each drug on the content of glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) in whole brain, in addition to the plasma levels of glucose, beta-HB and lactate. The results showed that (i), ischemia elevated the brain levels of LDH and beta-HB, as well as the plasma level of glucose, beta-HB, lactate and erythocytic GR. Conversely, it lowered glucose, SOD and GR levels in the brain; (ii), reperfusion reversed the ischemic effect on all the previously altered parameters except for plasma levels of lactate and glucose; (iii), melatonin (10 mg/kg, i.p) and nifedipine (1.5 mg/kg, i.p), restored the energy fuel levels in the brain of ischemic and I/R rats, as well as the ischemic effect on the erythocyte activities of SOD and GR. Furthermore, both drugs reversed I/R effect on the cytosolic activities of the antioxidant enzymes.

These acids have to be extruded from the cytosol to avoid disturbances of intracellular pH (pH(i)). To evaluate acid extrusion, pH(i) was studied in cultured ruminal epithelial cells of sheep using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. Extracellular addition of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, or lactate (20 mM) resulted in intracellular acidification. Vice versa, removing extracellular D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, or lactate after preincubation with the respective monocarboxylate induced an increase of pH(i). Initial rate of pH(i) decrease as well as of pH(i) recovery was strongly inhibited by pCMBS (400 microM) and phloretin (20 microM). Both cultured cells and intact ruminal epithelium were tested for the possible presence of proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) on both the mRNA and protein levels. With the use of RT-PCR, mRNA encoding for MCT1 isoform was demonstrated in cultured ruminal epithelial cells and the ruminal epithelium. Immunostaining with MCT1 antibodies intensively labeled cultured ruminal epithelial cells and cells located in the stratum basale of the ruminal epithelium.

12832326,Endogenous glutamate contributes to the maintenance of glutathione level under oxidative stress in isolated nerve terminals.,"Exposure of isolated nerve terminals to hydrogen peroxide (25-500 microM) for 10 min produced a partially reversible decrease in the total and reduced glutathione level. No release and resynthesis of glutathione by the oxidant was involved in this effect. Loss of reduced glutathione was associated with elimination of H(2)O(2), which was very quick with >70% of the oxidant eliminated within 5 min. Recovery of both total and reduced glutathione was pronounced after 10 min when the majority of H(2)O(2) was eliminated. Previously we have reported that glutamate metabolism under oxidative stress contributes to the operation of the Krebs cycle, thus to the production of NAD(P)H [J. Neurosci. 20 (2000) 8972]. In the present study we addressed whether metabolism of endogenous glutamate plays a role in the maintenance of glutathione level in nerve terminals. Glutamine and beta-hydroxybutyrate (5mM), alternative metabolites in synaptosomes, were able to decrease the loss of total and reduced glutathione induced by hydrogen peroxide. Metabolic consumption of glutamate was reduced at the same time. In addition an increased demand on the glutathione system by the catalase inhibitor aminotriazole augmented the metabolic consumption of glutamate. It is concluded that under oxidative stress glutamate metabolism contributes to the maintenance of glutathione level, thus to the antioxidant capacity of nerve terminals.",IL6,type 1 diabetic patients; healthy siblings; U937 monocytes,human; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"ROS generation, no-change",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,blood,Blood,U937 monocytes,Hematopoietic / Immune,Monocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",exogenous addition,NS,NS

This study examined the hypothesis that ketosis increases the circulating levels of IL-6 in type 1 diabetic patients as well as the secretion of IL-6 in vitro in a cell culture model using U937 monocytes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fasting blood was obtained from type 1 diabetic patients and healthy siblings. To examine the effect of ketosis, U937 monocytes were cultured with ketone bodies (acetoacetate [AA], beta-hydroxybutyrate [BHB]) in the presence or absence of high glucose levels in the medium at 37 degrees C for 24 h. IL-6 was determined by the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was detected using dihydroethidium dye. RESULTS: The blood level of IL-6 was higher in hyperketonemic (HK) diabetic patients than in normoketonemic (NK) diabetic patients (P < 0.05) and normal control subjects (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between ketosis and IL-6 levels (r = 0.36, P < 0.04, n = 34) in the blood of diabetic patients. Cell culture studies found that exogenous addition of the ketone body AA, but not BHB, increases IL-6 secretion and ROS generation in U937 cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevented the IL-6 secretion in acetoacetate-treated U937 monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that hyperketonemia increases IL-6 levels in the blood of type 1 diabetic patients and that NAC can inhibit IL-6 secretion by U937 monocytic cells cultured in a ketotic medium.",0,Male Sprague Dawley rats; volume-controlled hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation,animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Other Mammal,"metabolic modulation, no-change",Metabolic Regulation,lung,Lung,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hemorrhagic shock,Injury & Trauma,"pulmonary apoptosis, down","Apoptosis, down",ketone Ringer's solution with lactate substituted by BHB (KR),Intravenous BHB,NS

Experimental groups included the following: (1) sham, (2) no resuscitation (NR), (3) racemic lactated Ringer's (DL-LR) solution, (4) LR containing L-isomer only (L-LR), (5) ketone Ringer's solution with lactate substituted by BHB (KR), and (6) pyruvate Ringer's solution with lactate substituted by pyruvate (PR). The resuscitation fluids were infused during 45 minutes simultaneously with additional hemorrhage of 8 mL/kg. Hemodynamic and physiologic parameters and the plasma levels of BHB were serially measured. The animals were killed 2 hours after resuscitation, and tissues were frozen instantaneously for cellular adenylate extraction and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate analysis. Pulmonary apoptosis was studied using Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Expression of enzymes involved in ketogenesis and ketolysis was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: NR and resuscitation with DL-LR increased the expression of apoptotic markers, whereas resuscitation with KR and PR significantly decreased the expression of apoptotic markers in rat lungs. Resuscitation with KR was followed by a profound increase in plasma BHB levels; however, the expression levels of ketolytic enzymes were essentially unaffected. KR infusion did not induce significant improvements in tissue ATP levels. CONCLUSIONS: Resuscitation with KR and PR protects against pulmonary apoptosis without improving tissue ATP content. Therefore, metabolic modulation is unlikely to be the major mechanism by which BHB exerts its protective effects during reperfusion.",0; ACACA,anesthetized pigs,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"fatty acid uptake and oxidation, down",Metabolic Regulation,myocardium,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",intravenous infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate (25 micromol.kg-1.min-1),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
12975474,beta-Hydroxybutyrate inhibits myocardial fatty acid oxidation in vivo independent of changes in malonyl-CoA content.,"This study tested the hypothesis that an acute infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibits myocardial fatty acid uptake and oxidation in vivo. Anesthetized pigs were untreated (n = 6) or treated with an intravenous infusion of fat emulsion (n = 7) to elevate plasma free fatty acid levels. A third group received fat emulsion plus an intravenous infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate (25 micromol.kg-1.min-1; n = 7) for 60 min. All animals received a continuous infusion of [3H]palmitate, and myocardial fatty acid oxidation was measured from the cardiac production of 3H2O. Plasma free fatty acid concentrations were elevated in the fat emulsion group (0.77 +/- 0.11 mM) compared with the untreated group (0.15 +/- 0.03 mM), which resulted in greater myocardial free fatty acid oxidation. In contrast, the group receiving beta-hydroxybutyrate in addition to fat emulsion had elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration (0.87 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.01 mM), but suppressed fatty acid oxidation (0.053 +/- 0.013 micromol.g-1.min-1) (P < 0.05) compared with the fat emulsion group (0.116 +/- 0.029 micromol.g-1.min-1). There were no differences among the three groups in the tissue content for malonyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, or free CoA or the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase; thus the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate did not appear to be due to malonyl-CoA inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-I or to an increase in the acetyl-CoA-to-free CoA ratio. In conclusion, fatty acid uptake and oxidation is blocked by an infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate; this effect was not due to elevated myocardial malonyl-CoA content.",0,MPTP-treated mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"mitochondrial respiration, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,nigrostriatal region,Brain/CNS,dopaminergic neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Parkinson's disease,Neurodegenerative,"dopaminergic neurodegeneration, down; motor deficits, down","Neuronal survival, down; Motor function, down",d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DbetaHB) infusion,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

Here we show that the infusion of the ketone body d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DbetaHB) in mice confers partial protection against dopaminergic neurodegeneration and motor deficits induced by MPTP. These effects appear to be mediated by a complex II-dependent mechanism that leads to improved mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. Because of the safety record of ketone bodies in the treatment of epilepsy and their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, DbetaHB may be a novel neuroprotective therapy for PD.",GRIN1; 0,cultured rodent neocortical neurons,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"voltage-dependent blockade, down",Ion & Nutrient Transport,neocortex,Brain/CNS,neocortical neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"seizure activity, down","Seizure activity, down",L-(+)-beta-hydroxybutyrate (L-BHB); both stereoisomers and racemate tested,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid); NS,L-BHB

In the present study, we asked whether these effects could be mediated by ionotropic glutamate or gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors. METHODS: We studied the effects of both stereoisomers of BHB (as well as the racemate), ACA, and DBA on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5methyl-4-isoxazole-proprionic acid (AMPA), and GABAA receptors in cultured rodent neocortical neurons by using whole-cell voltage-clamp recording techniques. RESULTS: Only L-BHB and DBA exerted a concentration- and voltage-dependent block of NMDA-evoked currents, whereas none of the tested substrates affected AMPA- or GABA-activated currents. The kinetics of whole-cell block by L-BHB and DBA were similar, providing additional evidence that DBA is responsible for the anticonvulsant activity of L-BHB. CONCLUSIONS: BHB and ACA do not exert direct actions on GABAA or ionotropic glutamate receptors in cultured neocortical neurons. In addition, we provide additional evidence that DBA is responsible for the anticonvulsant activity of L-BHB, and that this action may be mediated in part by voltage-dependent blockade of NMDA receptors.",0,rats; isolated perfused hearts (Langendorff),animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"increased citrate level, up",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
14578386,Impairment of glucose metabolism in hearts from rats treated with endotoxin.,"OBJECTIVE: In patients and animals with sepsis or critical illness, the mechanical function of the heart is often impaired. Although these conditions are accompanied by dramatic metabolic and hormonal changes, little is known about alterations of cardiac metabolism. In this study, we assessed the impact of an endotoxin-induced inflammation on cardiac glucose utilization. METHODS: Bacterial endotoxin (1 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella typhimurium, LPS) was injected intravenously to rats. Six hours after LPS application, hearts were isolated and perfused in the Langendorff mode. RESULTS: Left ventricular pressure was reduced by 50% in hearts from LPS-treated rats, compared to those from saline-injected control animals. With glucose as the sole fuel, there was no difference in glycolysis between the groups. However, on addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate (an alternative fuel which inhibits phosphofructokinase via an increased citrate level), the glycolytic rate in the LPS group was 44 and 48% lower (in basal, and insulin-stimulated conditions, respectively; P<0.01) than in control hearts. At the end of perfusions with beta-hydroxybutyrate and insulin, the cardiac citrate content was 40% higher in LPS vs. controls (P<0.001). In addition to the reduced glycolysis, the insulin-dependent increase of cardiac glycogen was 77% smaller in LPS hearts. The difference between LPS and control glycolysis was abolished if the hearts were perfused with the ceramidase inhibitor N-oleyl-ethanolamine (5 microM), and also with the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor NS-398 (10 microM), or the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist SQ-29548 (1 microM). CONCLUSION: The inflammatory reaction caused by endotoxin impairs cardiac glucose metabolism (and in particular, the action of insulin) in at least two ways: through the exacerbation of the counterregulatory effect of alternative fuels on glycolysis, and through a reduction in net glycogen synthesis. Impairment of glycolysis may be mediated by a sphingomyelin derivative, and COX-2-derived thromboxane A2.",0,rat,animal,Animal – Rat,"chromatin condensation, down",Epigenetic Regulation,corneal epithelium,Eye/Retina,corneal epithelial cell,Epithelial – Skin & Eye,Corneal epithelium,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Ocular surface epithelial disorders; Dry eye syndrome,Ophthalmologic,"epithelial defect area, down","Wound healing, down","D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (HBA) (20, 40, 80 mM)",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

METHODS: Rat corneal epithelial erosion was induced by exposure of rat eyes to continuous low-humidity airflow, which accelerated the tear evaporation. During desiccation, one eye of each rat was treated with HBA (20, 40, or 80 mM) or rat serum (5%, 20%, or 100%), and in the other eye a drop of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was instilled as the control. Histopathologic examination and quantification of the epithelial defect area were performed. The apoptosis in the epithelia was determined by chromatin condensation using the Hoechst 33342 fluorescein probe. RESULTS: In PBS-treated eyes, thinning in the cell layer was seen on the periphery of the initial wound after 6 hours, and it progressed to defects after 12 hours. In the 80-mM HBA and 20% serum applications, the pathologic change in the epithelia was moderate, and the structure was maintained in an almost normal state in the 100% serum application. Significant decreases in the defect areas were observed in the 5%, 20%, and 100% serum and 40- and 80-mM HBA treatment groups compared with the PBS-treated eyes (n=12). A significant suppression of chromatin condensation was observed with HBA and serum treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the potential clinical application of HBA for ocular surface epithelial disorders to maintain epithelial cell viability in patients with dry eye.",CDKN1A; CDKN1B; 0; TGFB1; ACTA2,HK-2 cells,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"oxidative stress-mediated Smad2/3 activation, up",Multiple mechanisms,proximal tubule,Kidney,HK-2 cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,nucleus,Nucleus & Chromatin,Nucleoplasm,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cell cycle-dependent growth inhibition, up","Cell growth inhibition, up",NS,NS,NS
15070924,Beta-hydroxybutyrate-induced growth inhibition and collagen production in HK-2 cells are dependent on TGF-beta and Smad3.,"BACKGROUND: Ketonuria is common in diabetes. The major form of ketone body is beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), which is metabolized by the proximal tubule. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and tubulopathy are important in diabetic nephropathy. Thus, the role of TGF-beta and the downstream Smad3 in beta-HB-induced effects in the human proximal tubule (HK-2 cell) was studied. METHODS: Effects of beta-HB (0.1 to 10 mmol/L) on HK-2 cells were determined for: proliferation, cell cycle distribution, collagen production, tubular transdifferentiation [expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) protein], TGF-beta, Smad2/3, p21WAF1, and p27kip1. RESULTS: Beta-HB (0.1 to 10 mmol/L) dose dependently decreased proliferation, arrested the cells in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and increased p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression at 48 hours (without affecting p21WAF1/p27kip1 mRNA and transcription). beta-HB (1 mmol/L) increased p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein half-lives. Beta-HB (1 mmol/L) increased TGF-beta transcription at 24 hours and TGF-beta1 mRNA/bioactivity at 48 hours. Beta-HB (1 mmol/L) increased nuclear Smad2/3 protein expression and increased collagen production (without affecting tubular transdifferentiation), which were reversed by Smad7, dominant-negative Smad3, and N-acetylcysteine. Dominant-negative Smad3 reversed beta-HB-induced TGF-beta transcription at 24 hours, and reversed TGF-beta1 bioactivity at 48 hours. Dominant-negative Smad3 reversed beta-HB-induced p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression at 48 hours. Finally, N-acetylcysteine, TGF-beta antibody, Smad7, and dominant-negative Smad3 reversed beta-HB (1 mmol/L)-induced growth inhibition at 48 hours. CONCLUSION: Beta-HB activated Smad 2/3 by oxidative stress. TGF-beta and Smad3 mediate beta-HB-induced cell cycle-dependent growth inhibition while Smad3 mediate beta-HB-induced collagen production and p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression in HK-2 cells. Moreover, beta-HB increased p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression by increasing p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein stability.",0,healthy adults,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"ketosis, up",Metabolic Regulation,serum,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"insulin sensitivity, up; total cholesterol, up; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, up","Insulin sensitivity, up; Total cholesterol, up; LDL cholesterol, up",NS,NS,NS
15123336,Differential metabolic effects of saturated versus polyunsaturated fats in ketogenic diets.,"Ketogenic diets (KDs) are used for treatment of refractory epilepsy and metabolic disorders. The classic saturated fatty acid-enriched (SAT) KD has a fat:carbohydrate plus protein ratio of 4:1, in which the predominant fats are saturated. We hypothesized that a polyunsaturated fat-enriched (POLY) KD would induce a similar degree of ketosis with less detrimental effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Twenty healthy adults were randomized to two different weight-maintaining KDs for 5 d. Diets were 70% fat, 15% carbohydrate, and 15% protein. The fat contents were 60 or 15% saturated, 15 or 60% polyunsaturated, and 25% monounsaturated for SAT and POLY, respectively. Changes in serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, insulin sensitivity (S(I)), and lipid profiles were measured. Mean circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate levels increased 8.4 mg/dl in the POLY group (P = 0.0004), compared with 3.1 mg/dl in the SAT group (P = 0.07). S(I) increased significantly in the POLY group (P = 0.02), whereas total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly in the SAT group (both P = 0.002). These data demonstrate that a short-term POLY KD induces a greater level of ketosis and improves S(I), without adversely affecting total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with a traditional SAT KD. Thus, a POLY KD may be superior to a classical SAT KD for chronic administration.",0,Alzheimer's disease; mild cognitive impairment,human,NS,"alternative energy substrate, positive",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease; Mild cognitive impairment,Neurodegenerative,"cognition (ADAS-cog) up, nan; paragraph recall up, nan","Cognition, nan; Memory (general), nan",oral emulsified medium chain triglycerides (MCTs),MCT / Medium-chain fats,NS

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), there appears to be a pathological decrease in the brain's ability to use glucose. Neurobiological evidence suggests that ketone bodies are an effective alternative energy substrate for the brain. Elevation of plasma ketone body levels through an oral dose of medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) may improve cognitive functioning in older adults with memory disorders. On separate days, 20 subjects with AD or mild cognitive impairment consumed a drink containing emulsified MCTs or placebo. Significant increases in levels of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) were observed 90 min after treatment (P=0.007) when cognitive tests were administered. beta-OHB elevations were moderated by apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype (P=0.036). For 4+ subjects, beta-OHB levels continued to rise between the 90 and 120 min blood draws in the treatment condition, while the beta-OHB levels of 4- subjects held constant (P<0.009). On cognitive testing, MCT treatment facilitated performance on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) for 4- subjects, but not for 4+ subjects (P=0.04). Higher ketone values were associated with greater improvement in paragraph recall with MCT treatment relative to placebo across all subjects (P=0.02).

15195553,Ketone bodies could support the motility but not the acrosome reaction of mouse sperm.,"Ketone bodies, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, produced by the metabolism of fatty acids, are an important energy source for many organs, especially the heart, kidney and brain. They are utilized by the body with the help of succinyl CoA transferase (SCOT), which is ubiquitously expressed in various organs. Previously, we identified a novel SCOT-t specifically expressed in testicular germ cells and sperm, substituting somatic cell-type SCOT, however the physiological role of SCOT-t had not then been clarified. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ketone bodies, the substrate of SCOT-t, on the motility and acrosome reaction of mouse sperm. D-beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate both stimulated the motility of sperm as glucose or pyruvate. The glycolysis inhibitor stopped the motility of sperm mediated by glucose but not by D-beta-hydroxybutyrate. In contrast, ketone bodies did not stimulate the activation of the acrosome reaction of sperm, different from the effect of glucose. These results indicate that ketone bodies could be involved in sperm movement but not the acrosome reaction and the SCOT-t enzyme we have identified in sperm mitochondria may have important roles in the activity of sperm, resulting in male infertility when its function is disabled.",ACE,perfused rabbit lungs,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, down",Vascular Function & Angiogenesis,lung,Lung,endothelial cell,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Pulmonary endothelial cell dysfunction,Respiratory,"endothelial function, down; hemorrhage, up; neutrophil infiltration, up; dry-to-wet weight ratio, down","Endothelial function, down; Brain injury, up; Inflammation, up; dry-to-wet weight ratio, down","beta-Hydroxybutyrate (beta OHB), at 5 mM",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Dry to wet weight ratios were also reduced in lungs perfused with 5 mM beta OHB, but not with AcAc. beta OHB, at 5 mM, caused massive hemorrhage and interstitial and alveolar neutrophil infiltration; AcAc only produced engorgement of septal capillaries.

We hypothesized that following traumatic brain injury (TBI), which results in immediate changes in energy metabolism, the adult brain increases uptake and oxidation of the alternative substrate beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB). Arterio-venous differences were used to determine global cerebral uptake of betaHB and production of 14CO2 from [14C]3-betaHB 3 h after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. Quantitative bioluminescence was used to assess regional changes in ATP concentration. As expected, adult sham and CCI animals with only endogenously available betaHB showed no significant increase in cerebral uptake of betaHB or 14CO2 production. Increasing arterial betaHB concentrations 2.9-fold with 3 h of betaHB infusion failed to increase cerebral uptake of betaHB or 14CO2 production in adult sham animals. Only CCI animals that received a 3-h betaHB infusion showed an 8.5-fold increase in cerebral uptake of betaHB and greater than 10.7-fold increase in 14CO2 production relative to sham betaHB-infused animals.

15469939,D-lactate increases pulmonary apoptosis by restricting phosphorylation of bad and eNOS in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock.,"Resuscitation with racemic lactated Ringer's solution (containing equal amounts of D and L isomers of lactate) has been shown to induce pulmonary apoptosis. Substitution of DL-isomer lactate with ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate, BHB), sodium pyruvate, or L-isomer of lactate decrease this injury without changing the energy status of the tissues or the expression of apoptotic genes. These modified solutions however alter the function of apoptotic proteins through an unknown mechanism. We postulated that DL-LR induces apoptosis by restricting the phosphorylation of key apoptotic proteins. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 30, 5/group) were subjected to a three stage, volume-controlled hemorrhage and randomized to the following groups. 1) No hemorrhage (Sham); 2) Hemorrhage and no resuscitation (NR); 3) Resuscitation with 3x shed blood volume of racemic LR (DL-LR); 4) Resuscitation with 3x shed blood volume of LR containing only the L-isomer of lactate (L-LR); 5) Resuscitation with 3s shed blood volume of pyruvate Ringer's (PR); 6) Resuscitation with 3s shed blood volume of ketone Ringer's (KR). The modified Ringer's solutions were identical to racemic LR except for equimolar substitution of DL-lactate for L-lactate, pyruvate and BHB respectively. Lung tissue was obtained 2 hours later and subjected to Western Blotting. The levels of Akt, Bad, and eNOS (total and phosphorylated) proteins were measured. Finally, the expression of gene coding for protein 14-3-3 was measured using RT-PCR. RESULTS: Resuscitation with DL-LR caused a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the total Bad and a decrease in phosphorylated Bad protein expression in the lung. It also caused an increase in the phosphorylated Akt levels and a decrease in gene coding for protein 14-3-3. These changes were consistent with signaling imbalances that favor apoptosis. Modified LR solutions, on the other hand, did not cause these alterations. Phosphorylation pattern of eNOS supported the involvement of PI3K/Akt pathway in this process.

15479955,Distinct mechanisms of neurodegeneration induced by chronic complex I inhibition in dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cells.,"Chronic mitochondrial dysfunction, in particular of complex I, has been strongly implicated in the dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. To elucidate the mechanisms of chronic complex I disruption-induced neurodegeneration, we induced differentiation of immortalized midbrain dopaminergic (MN9D) and non-dopaminergic (MN9X) neuronal cells, to maintain them in culture without significant cell proliferation and compared their survivals following chronic exposure to nanomolar rotenone, an irreversible complex I inhibitor. Rotenone killed more dopaminergic MN9D cells than non-dopaminergic MN9X cells. Oxidative stress played an important role in rotenone-induced neurodegeneration of MN9X cells, but not MN9D cells: rotenone oxidatively modified proteins more in MN9X cells than in MN9D cells and antioxidants decreased rotenone toxicity only in MN9X cells. MN9X cells were also more sensitive to exogenous oxidants than MN9D cells. In contrast, disruption of bioenergetics played a more important role in MN9D cells: rotenone decreased mitochondrial membrane protential and ATP levels in MN9D cells more than in MN9X cells. Supplementation of cellular energy with a ketone body, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, decreased rotenone toxicity in MN9D cells, but not in MN9X cells. MN9D cells were also more susceptible to disruption of oxidative phosphorylation or glycolysis than MN9X cells. These findings indicate that, during chronic rotenone exposure, MN9D cells die primarily through mitochondrial energy disruption, whereas MN9X cells die primarily via oxidative stress. Thus, intrinsic properties of individual cell types play important roles in determining the predominant mechanism of complex I inhibition-induced neurodegeneration.",INS,rat pancreatic islets,animal,Animal – Rat,"NADH supply to respiratory chain, down",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,pancreatic islets,Pancreas,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",5 mM d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (HB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB
15677509,Chronic exposure to beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibits glucose-induced insulin release from pancreatic islets by decreasing NADH contents.,"To investigate the effects of chronic exposure to ketone bodies on glucose-induced insulin secretion, we evaluated insulin release, intracellular Ca2+ and metabolism, and Ca2+ efficacy of the exocytotic system in rat pancreatic islets. Fifteen-hour exposure to 5 mM d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (HB) reduced high glucose-induced insulin secretion and augmented basal insulin secretion. Augmentation of basal release was derived from promoting the Ca2+-independent and ATP-independent component of insulin release, which was suppressed by the GDP analog. Chronic exposure to HB affected mostly the second phase of glucose-induced biphasic secretion. Dynamic experiments showed that insulin release and NAD(P)H fluorescence were lower, although the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) was not affected 10 min after exposure to high glucose. Additionally, [Ca2+](i) efficacy in exocytotic system at clamped concentrations of ATP was not affected. NADH content, ATP content, and ATP-to-ADP ratio in the HB-cultured islets in the presence of high glucose were lower, whereas glucose utilization and oxidation were not affected. Mitochondrial ATP production shows that the respiratory chain downstream of complex II is not affected by chronic exposure to HB, and that the decrease in ATP production is due to decreased NADH content in the mitochondrial matrix. Chronic exposure to HB suppresses glucose-induced insulin secretion by lowering the ATP level, at least partly by inhibiting ATP production by reducing the supply of NADH to the respiratory chain. Glucose-induced insulin release in the presence of aminooxyacetate was not reduced, which implies that chronic exposure to HB affects the malate/aspartate shuttle and thus reduces NADH supply to mitochondria.",SLC12A2,Sprague-Dawley rats; streptozotocin-induced DKA,animal,Animal – Rat,"Na-K-Cl cotransporter activity, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,brain,Brain/CNS,brain microvascular endothelial cells,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Metabolic & Endocrine,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

Previous studies have shown that the Na-K-Cl cotransporter of cerebral microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes is a major participant in ischemia-induced cerebral edema in stroke. The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the Na-K-Cl cotransporter also contributes to cerebral edema in DKA. Sprague-Dawley rats were administered streptozotocin to induce DKA, and then cerebral edema was assessed by determination of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) with magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging. Cerebral ADC values in DKA rats were significantly reduced in both cortex and striatum compared with non-DKA control rats, indicating the presence of cerebral edema. Intravenous administration of bumetanide to DKA rats abolished the drop in cortical ADC values, while having no significant effect in the striatum. Insulin and saline treatment had no effect when given after bumetanide but increased both cortical and striatal ADC values when given before bumetanide. Evidence is also presented here that acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate stimulate brain microvascular Na-K-Cl cotransporter activity.

The presence of bHB also decreased the number of neurons exhibiting condensed nuclei visualized by propidium iodide, indicative of apoptosis. The mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Em/c) was maintained for up to 2 hr exposure to hypoxia in the bHB-treated group, whereas the potential in the control group was decreased. Furthermore, cytochrome C release, caspase-3 activation, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage were decreased in the bHB-treated group for the first 2 hr of exposure. These findings indicate that ketone bodies may be a candidate for widening the therapeutic window before thrombolytic therapy and at the same time decreasing apoptotic damage in the ischemic penumbra.",GAPDH; RNASE1; LAMP2; HSPA8,cells; isolated lysosomes,in vitro,NS; In vitro – Primary cells,"protein oxidation, up",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,lysosome,Lysosome,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",physiological concentrations,NS,NS
15929991,Ketone bodies stimulate chaperone-mediated autophagy.,"Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective lysosomal protein degradative process that is activated in higher organisms under conditions of prolonged starvation and in cell culture by the removal of serum. Ketone bodies are comprised of three compounds (beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone) that circulate during starvation, especially during prolonged starvation. Here we have investigated the hypothesis that ketone bodies induce CMA. We found that physiological concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOH) induced proteolysis in cells maintained in media with serum and without serum; however, acetoacetate only induced proteolysis in cells maintained in media with serum. Lysosomes isolated from BOH-treated cells displayed an increased ability to degrade both glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ribonuclease A, substrates for CMA. Isolated lysosomes from cells maintained in media without serum also demonstrated an increased ability to degrade glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ribonuclease A when the reaction was supplemented with BOH. Such treatment did not affect the levels of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2a or lysosomal heat shock cognate protein of 70 kDa, two rate-limiting proteins in CMA. However, pretreatment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and ribonuclease A with BOH increased their rate of degradation by isolated lysosomes. Lysosomes pretreated with BOH showed no increase in proteolysis, suggesting that BOH acts on the substrates to increase their rates of proteolysis. Using OxyBlot analysis to detect carbonyl formation on proteins, one common marker of protein oxidation, we showed that treatment of substrates with BOH increased their oxidation. Neither glycerol, another compound that increases in circulation during prolonged starvation, nor butanol or butanone, compounds closely related to BOH, had an effect on CMA. The induction of CMA by ketone bodies may provide an important physiological mechanism for the activation of CMA during prolonged starvation.",HCAR2,mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"PUMA-G/HM74a activation, up",Inflammation & Immune Response,adipose tissue,Adipose tissue,adipocytes,Adipose,White adipocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Metabolic & Endocrine,"ketoacidosis, down","Ketoacidosis, down",fatty acid-derived ketone body,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),D-BHB
15980225,(D)-beta-Hydroxybutyrate inhibits adipocyte lipolysis via the nicotinic acid receptor PUMA-G.,"As a treatment for dyslipidemia, oral doses of 1-3 grams of nicotinic acid per day lower serum triglycerides, raise high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and reduce mortality from coronary heart disease (Tavintharan, S., and Kashyap, M. L. (2001) Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 3, 74-82). These benefits likely result from the ability of nicotinic acid to inhibit lipolysis in adipocytes and thereby reduce serum non-esterified fatty acid levels (Carlson, L. A. (1963) Acta Med. Scand. 173, 719-722). In mice, nicotinic acid inhibits lipolysis via PUMA-G, a Gi/o-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor expressed in adipocytes and activated macrophages (Tunaru, S., Kero, J., Schaub, A., Wufka, C., Blaukat, A., Pfeffer, K., and Offermanns, S. (2003) Nat. Med. 9, 352-355). The human ortholog HM74a is also a nicotinic acid receptor and likely has a similar role in anti-lipolysis. Endogenous levels of nicotinic acid are too low to significantly impact receptor activity, hence the natural ligands(s) of HM74a/PUMA-G remain to be elucidated. Here we show that the fatty acid-derived ketone body (D)-beta-hydroxybutyrate ((D)-beta-OHB) specifically activates PUMA-G/HM74a at concentrations observed in serum during fasting. Like nicotinic acid, (D)-beta-OHB inhibits mouse adipocyte lipolysis in a PUMA-G-dependent manner and is thus the first endogenous ligand described for this orphan receptor. These findings suggests a homeostatic mechanism for surviving starvation in which (D)-beta-OHB negatively regulates its own production, thereby preventing ketoacidosis and promoting efficient use of fat stores.",0,rat dry eye model; JB-treated rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,corneal epithelium,Eye/Retina,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Dry eye syndrome,Ophthalmologic,"punctate staining, down","Staining pattern, down",eye drops containing 80 mM HBA,In vitro media supplementation,D-BHB

The protective effect of d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (HBA) on the corneal epithelia was also investigated. METHODS: A series of treatments were performed under continuous exposure to low-humidity airflow. Rats were placed on a jogging board (JB) made of a plastic pipe for 7.5 h/d, and, for 16.5 hours, they were placed in individual cages without JB treatment. The resultant changes in tear dynamics and corneal epithelial structure were then analyzed. Five days after the rats were exposed to the treatment, eyes that showed corneal fluorescein staining were examined, to investigate the effect of HBA, by administration of eye drops containing 80 mM HBA four times daily during JB treatment for 5 days. RESULTS: Significant reductions in blink frequency, Schirmer score, and tear clearance were recorded during JB treatment in eyes that showed persistent punctate staining of almost one half of the corneal surface. The application of HBA-containing eye drops significantly reduced the punctate staining compared with the initial or phosphate-buffered saline-treated eyes. CONCLUSIONS: This rat dry eye model, established by repeated JB treatment in desiccating conditions, induced abnormal tear dynamics and superficial punctate keratopathy similar to that in humans. These findings suggest the potential clinical application of HBA in corneal surface epithelial disorders in patients with moderate to mild dry eye.",0,wakeful rat,human; animal,Animal – Rat,"direct effect on the cerebral endothelium, up",Vascular Function & Angiogenesis,brain,Brain/CNS,cerebral endothelium,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cerebral blood flow, up; cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen, no-change; cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, no-change","Cerebral blood flow, up; Oxygen consumption, no-change; Cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, no-change",infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

The mechanism by which this effect of ketone bodies was mediated is not known. Alterations in several parameters may possibly explain the increase in CBF and the resetting of the relation between CBF and cerebral metabolism. To study this phenomenon further, we measured global CBF and global cerebral metabolism with the Kety-Schmidt technique in the wakeful rat before and during infusion of ketone bodies. During acute hyperketonemia (average concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate: 6 mmol/L), global CBF increased 65% from 108 to 178 mL/100 g min and the cerebral metabolic rates for both oxygen and glucose remained constant. This resetting of the relation between CBF and cerebral metabolism could not be explained by alterations in blood pH or arterial CO2 tension. By measuring cerebral intracellular pH by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, it could further be concluded that the brain pH was unchanged during acute hyperketonemia. These observations indicate that the mechanism responsible for the increase in CBF is rather a direct effect on the cerebral endothelium than via some metabolic interactions.",0,Caenorhabditis elegans expressing alpha-synuclein; parkin deletion (K08E3.7); DJ-1 knockdown (B0432.2); parkin knockdown; nontransgenic nematodes,animal,Animal – Invertebrate; NS; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"mitochondrial complex II activation, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Parkinson's disease,Neurodegenerative,"vulnerability to mitochondrial complex I inhibitors, down","Cell viability, down",D-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

We have now compared the patterns of vulnerability and rescue of Caenorhabditis elegans with genetic modifications of three different genetic factors implicated in Parkinson disease (PD). We observed that expressing alpha-synuclein, deleting parkin (K08E3.7), or knocking down DJ-1 (B0432.2) or parkin produces similar patterns of pharmacological vulnerability and rescue. C. elegans lines with these genetic changes were more vulnerable than nontransgenic nematodes to mitochondrial complex I inhibitors, including rotenone, fenperoximate, pyridaben, or stigmatellin. In contrast, the genetic manipulations did not increase sensitivity to paraquat, sodium azide, divalent metal ions (Fe(II) or Cu(II)), or etoposide compared with the nontransgenic nematodes. Each of the PD-related lines was also partially rescued by the antioxidant probucol, the mitochondrial complex II activator, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, or the anti-apoptotic bile acid tauroursodeoxycholic acid. Complete protection in all lines was achieved by combining d-beta-hydroxybutyrate with tauroursodeoxycholic acid but not with probucol. These results show that diverse PD-related genetic modifications disrupt the mitochondrial function in C. elegans, and they raise the possibility that mitochondrial disruption is a pathway shared in common by many types of familial PD.",BAD; AKT1; NOS3; BCL2; PARP1,Sprague Dawley rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"PI3K/Akt pathway, no-change",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hepatic apoptosis,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"apoptosis, down","Apoptosis, down",ketone (beta-hydroxybuturate) Ringer's (KR),Ketone salt (KS),NS

This study was conducted to determine if the elimination of D-lactate isomer would attenuate apoptosis in the liver, and to investigate the possible mechanisms. STUDY DESIGN: Sprague Dawley rats (n=30, 5 per group) were subjected to modified volume-controlled hemorrhage and randomized to the following groups: no hemorrhage (sham); no resuscitation (NR); resuscitation with racemic lactated Ringer's (DL-LR); L-isomer LR (L-LR); ketone (beta-hydroxybuturate) Ringer's (KR); or pyruvate Ringer's (PR). Animals were sacrificed 2 hours later and expressions of proapoptotic proteins (BAD), antiapoptotic (bcl-2) proteins, and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage in liver were analyzed by Western blotting. Contribution of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/serine/threonine kinase (PI3k/Akt) pathway was assessed by measuring total and phosphorylated PI3K, Akt, BAD, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) proteins. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to detect the apoptotic cells. Liver ATP levels were measured using a luciferase reaction assay. RESULTS: Hemorrhage significantly decreased the hepatic ATP level and resuscitation improved it, but it returned to normal only in the L-isomer lactated Ringer's and ketone Ringer's groups. Expression of proapoptotic proteins was significantly lower in the pyruvate Ringer's and ketone Ringer's groups; L-isomer lactated Ringer's and pyruvate Ringer's resuscitation significantly increased bcl-2 expression. Poly-ADP ribose polymerase fragmentation and total number of apoptotic cells were significantly increased in the racemic lactated Ringer's group. There was no significant induction of Akt activity or changes in phosphorylated BAD, Akt, or eNOS levels. CONCLUSIONS: Resuscitation with racemic lactated Ringer's induces hepatic apoptosis, which is decreased if the D-isomer of lactate is eliminated. Apoptosis is reduced even more when lactate is substituted with beta-hydroxybutyrate or pyruvate. The beneficial effects are not through improvements in the energy status or activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.",ANXA5,HT22 cell line; rat primary hippocampal neurons,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line; Animal – Rat,"ROS production, down",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,hippocampal neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"neuronal cell death, down","Neuronal survival, down",4 mM Na beta-OHB,In vitro media supplementation,NS
16456436,Acetoacetate protects neuronal cells from oxidative glutamate toxicity.,"Glutamate cytotoxicity contributes to neuronal degeneration in many central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as epilepsy and ischemia. We previously reported that a high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet, the ketogenic diet (KD), protects against kainic acid-induced hippocampal cell death in mice. We hypothesized based on these findings that ketosis resulting from KD might inhibit glutamate cytotoxicity, resulting in inhibition of hippocampal neuronal cell death. Therefore, we investigated the role of ketone bodies [acetoacetate (AA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB)] both in a mouse hippocampal cell line (HT22) and in rat primary hippocampal neurons. As a result, we found that pretreatment with 5 mM lithium AA and 4 mM Na beta-OHB protected the HT22 hippocampal cell line and primary hippocampal neuronal culture against 5 mM glutamate toxicity and that up to 2 hr of pretreatment with 5 mM AA had a protective effect against 5 mM glutamate toxicity in the HT22 cell line. Pretreatment with 5 mM AA decreased ROS production of HT22 cell line at 2 and 8 hr exposure of glutamate, and it decreased the appearance of annexin V-positive HT22 cells, which are indicative of an early stage of apoptosis, and propidium iodide-positive HT22 cells, which are indicative of necrosis.",TNF,Yorkshire swine; hemorrhagic shock model,animal,Animal – Other Mammal; NS,"apoptosis, down",Cell Death & Survival,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hemorrhagic shock,Injury & Trauma,"apoptotic cell death, down","Apoptosis, down",Ketone Ringer's (KR),Intravenous BHB,NS

Our hypothesis was that in a clinically relevant large animal model of hemorrhage, resuscitation with racemic lactated Ringer's solution would induce cellular apoptosis, which can be attenuated by elimination of d-lactate. METHODS: Yorkshire swine (n = 49, weight 40-58 kg) were subjected to uncontrolled (iliac arterial and venous injuries) and controlled hemorrhage, totaling 40% of estimated blood volume. They were randomized (n = 7/group) to control groups, which consisted of (1) no hemorrhage (NH), (2) no resuscitation (NR), or resuscitation groups, which consisted of (3) 0.9% saline (NS), (4) racemic lactated Ringer's (DL-LR), (5) L-isomer lactated Ringer's (L-LR), (6) Ketone Ringer's (KR), (7) 6% hetastarch in 0.9% saline (Hespan). KR was identical to LR except for equimolar substitution of lactate with beta-hydroxybutyrate. Resuscitation was performed in three phases, simulating (1) prehospital, (2) operative, (3) postoperative/recovery periods. Arterial blood gasses, circulating cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1, -6, -10), and markers of organ injury were serially measured. Metabolic activity of brain, and liver, was measured with microdialysis. Four hours postinjury, organs were harvested for Western blotting, ELISA, TUNEL assay, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: All resuscitation strategies restored blood pressure, but clearance of lactic acidosis was impeded following DL-LR resuscitation. Metabolic activity decreased during shock and improved with resuscitation, without any significant inter-group differences. Levels of cytokines in circulation were similar, but tissue levels of TNF in liver and lung increased six- and threefolds (p < 0.05) in NR group. In liver, all resuscitation strategies significantly decreased TNF levels compared with the NR group, but in the lung resuscitation with lactated Ringer (DL and L isomers) failed to decrease tissue TNF levels. DL-LR resuscitation also increased apoptosis (p < 0.05) in liver and lung, which was not seen after resuscitation with other solutions. CONCLUSIONS: In this large animal model of hemorrhagic shock, resuscitation with conventional (racemic) LR solution increased apoptotic cell death in liver and lung.

We report that HB (0.02 g/l) promoted cell proliferation in cultured L929 cells plated at high cell density (1 x 10(5) cells/well) but not lower cell densities. While HB did not affect cell cycle progression, it significantly inhibited cell death. HB treatment prevented necrosis, reducing cell membrane permeability 4h following serum withdrawal from the medium, and for all subsequent time points. In summary, HB promotes proliferation of L929 cells in high-density cultures by preventing apoptotic and necrotic cell death.

This research project's objective was to create a comprehensive summary of changes in gene expression after hemorrhagic shock (HS), reliant and impartial of multiple variables, such as resuscitation treatments, organ analyzed, and time after impact. METHODS: Rat model of severe (40% total blood loss) HS was employed. Hemorrhagic shock was treated with 6 different resuscitation strategies: (1) racemic lactated Ringer's (DL-LR); (2) L-lactated Ringer's (L-LR); (3) ketone Ringer's (KR); (4) pyruvate Ringer's (PR); (5) 6% hetastarch (Hex); (6) 7.5% hypertonic saline (HTS). Nonresuscitated and nonhemorrhaged rats served as controls. Ketone and pyruvate Ringer solutions were identical to the lactated Ringer's solution except for equimolar substitution of lactate with beta-hydroxybutyrate and sodium pyruvate, respectively. Total RNA from liver, lung, and spleen was isolated immediately (0 hour) and 24 hour postresuscitation. Each organ, time point and treatment was profiled using individual cDNA array (1,200 genes), to produce 183 separate data files. Methods of analysis included one-way and unbalanced factorial ANOVA, Sokal-Michener average linkage clustering and contextual mapping. RESULTS: : Unresuscitated HS produced the highest number (56) of upregulated expressions in spleen and lungs. HEX and HTS affected mostly pulmonary genes (22 and 9). Fourteen genes changed in response to combination of all three factors: treatment, organ, and time. Eighteen genes were identified as treatment-specific. Fifteen genes adjusted expression 24 hour post-treatment. The largest number of genes with altered expression (168) responded differently in all three organs. In this study 15 gene clusters were pinpointed. Contextual mapping identified novel and confirmed known pathways contributing to hemorrhage/resuscitation. CONCLUSIONS: We have reliably identified genes and pathways that are affected by HS and are responsive to resuscitation.

We examined the impact of selectively elevating portal vein concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, or beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on the sympathoadrenal response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Male Wistar rats (n = 36), chronically cannulated in the carotid artery (sampling), jugular vein (infusion), and portal vein (infusion), underwent hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic ( approximately 2.5 mmol/l) clamps with either portal or jugular vein infusions of lactate, pyruvate, or BHB. By design, arterial concentrations of glucose and the selected metabolite were matched between portal and jugular (NS). Portal vein concentrations were significantly elevated in portal versus jugular (P < 0.0001) for lactate (5.03 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.84 +/- 0.08 mmol/l), pyruvate (1.81 +/- 0.21 vs. 0.42 +/- 0.03 mmol/l), or BHB (2.02 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.03 mmol/l). Elevating portal lactate or pyruvate suppressed both the epinephrine (64% decrease; P < 0.01) and norepinephrine (75% decrease; P < 0.05) responses to hypoglycemia. In contrast, elevating portal BHB levels failed to impact epinephrine (P = 0.51) or norepinephrine (P = 0.47) levels during hypoglycemia. These findings indicate that hypoglycemic detection at the portal vein is mediated by a sensor responding to some metabolic event(s) subsequent to the uptake and oxidation of glucose.",0,rats; perfused hearts; diaphragms,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"acetylation of carnitine, up",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

Free carnitine, acetylcarnitine, short-chain acylcarnitine and acid-insoluble carnitine (probably long-chain acylcarnitine) have been measured in rat tissues. 2. Starvation caused an increase in the proportion of carnitine that was acetylated in liver and kidney; at least in liver fat-feeding had the same effect, whereas a carbohydrate diet caused a very low acetylcarnitine content. 3. In heart, on the other hand, starvation did not cause an increase in the acetylcarnitine/carnitine ratio, whereas fat-feeding caused a decrease. The acetylcarnitine content of heart was diminished by alloxan-diabetes or a fatty diet, but not by re-feeding with carbohydrate. 4. Under conditions of increased fatty acid supply the acid-insoluble carnitine content was increased in heart, liver and kidney. 5. The acylation state of carnitine was capable of very rapid change. Concentrations of carnitine derivatives varied with different methods of obtaining tissue samples, and very little acid-insoluble carnitine was found in tissues of rats anaesthetized with Nembutal. In liver the acetylcarnitine (and acetyl-CoA) content decreased if freezing of tissue samples was delayed; in heart this caused an increase in acetylcarnitine. 6. Incubation of diaphragms with acetate or dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate caused the acetylcarnitine content to become elevated. 7. Perfusion of hearts with fatty acids containing an even number of carbon atoms, dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate or pyruvate resulted in increased contents of acetylcarnitine and acetyl-CoA. Accumulation of these acetyl compounds was prevented by the additional presence of propionate or pentanoate in the perfusion medium; this prevention was not due to extensive propionylation of CoA or carnitine. 8. Perfusion of hearts with palmitate caused a severalfold increase in the content of acid-insoluble carnitine; this increase did not occur when propionate was also present. 9. Comparison of the acetylation states of carnitine and CoA in perfused hearts suggests that the carnitine acetyltransferase reactants may remain near equilibrium despite wide variations in their steady-state concentrations. This is not the case with the citrate synthase reaction. It is suggested that the carnitine acetyltransferase system buffers the tissue content of acetyl-CoA against rapid changes.",0,Squalus acanthias,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"enhancement of gland activity, up",Other / Unspecified,rectal gland,Large intestine/Colon,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
16917840,Metabolic organization and effects of feeding on enzyme activities of the dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias) rectal gland.,"In order to investigate the metabolic poise of the elasmobranch rectal gland, we conducted two lines of experimentation. First, we examined the effects of feeding on plasma metabolites and enzyme activities from several metabolic pathways in several tissues of the dogfish shark, Squalus acanthias, after starvation and at 6, 20, 30 and 48 h post-feeding. We found a rapid and sustained ten-fold decrease in plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate at 6 h and beyond compared with starved dogfish, suggesting an upregulation in the use of this substrate, a decrease in production, or both. Plasma acetoacetate levels remain unchanged, whereas there was a slight and transient decrease in plasma glucose levels at 6 h. Several enzymes showed a large increase in activity post-feeding, including beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in rectal gland and liver, and in rectal gland, isocitrate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate amino transferase, alanine amino transferase, glutamine synthetase and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase. Also notable in these enzyme measurements was the overall high level of activity in the rectal gland in general. For example, activity of the Krebs' TCA cycle enzyme citrate synthase (over 30 U g(-1)) was similar to activities in muscle from other species of highly active fish. Surprisingly, lactate dehydrogenase activity in the gland was also high (over 150 U g(-1)), suggesting either an ability to produce lactate anaerobically or use lactate as an aerobic fuel. Given these interesting observations, in the second aspect of the study we examined the ability of several metabolic substrates (alone and in combination) to support chloride secretion by the rectal gland. Among the substrates tested at physiological concentrations (glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, alanine, acetoacetate, and glutamate), only glucose could consistently maintain a viable preparation. Whereas beta-hydroxybutyrate could enhance gland activity when presented in combination with glucose, surprisingly it could not sustain chloride secretion when used as a lone substrate. Our results are discussed in the context of the in vivo role of the gland and mechanisms of possible upregulation of enzyme activities.",CYCS; CASP9; CASP3; 0,SH-SY5Y dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells (differentiated by all-trans-retinoic acid),in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"mitochondrial respiration, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,mammalian brain,Brain/CNS,SH-SY5Y dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Parkinson's disease,Neurodegenerative,"neuronal survival, up","Survival, up",D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (bHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

Rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, provides models of PD both in vivo and in vitro. We investigated the neuroprotective effect of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (bHB), a ketone body, against rotenone toxicity by using SH-SY5Y dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells. SH-SY5Y cells, differentiated by all-trans-retinoic acid, were exposed to rotenone at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1,000 nM. We evaluated cellular oxidation reduction by the alamarBlue assay, viability by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, and survival/death ratio by live/dead assays. Exposure to rotenone for 48 hr oxidized cells and decreased their viability and survival rate in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of cells with 8 mM bHB provided significant protection to SH-SY5Y cells. Whereas rotenone caused the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, released cytochrome c into the cytosol, and reduced cytochrome c content in mitochondria, addition of bHB blocked this toxic effect. bHB also attenuated the rotenone-induced activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Administration of 0-10 mM 3-nitropropionic acid, a complex II inhibitor, also decreased the reducing power of SH-SY5Y cells measured by alamarBlue assay. Pretreatment with 8 mM bHB attenuated the decrease of alamarBlue fluorescence. These data demonstrated that bHB had a neuroprotective effect that supported the mitochondrial respiration system by reversing the inhibition of complex I or II.

We have already shown that chronic exposure to the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHB) decreases insulin-mediated activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes. To gain further insights into the mechanism underlying ketone body-induced insulin resistance, we examined whether OHB alters activation of the insulin-signaling cascade and whether the insulinomimetic agent vanadate could bypass insulin resistance and stimulate glucose uptake in these cells. Cardiomyocytes were incubated with 5 mM OHB, 50 microM vanadate or both for 16 h before the measurement of glucose uptake or the activation of insulin-signaling molecules. While chronic exposure to OHB did not alter insulin- or vanadate-mediated activation of the insulin receptor, it suppressed insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation in response to both agonists. Furthermore, this treatment decreased by 54 and 36% the phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and PKB in response to insulin, whereas it did not alter vanadate-mediated activation of these enzymes. Although insulin did not significantly stimulate p38MAPK phosphorylation, vanadate increased it by 3.8-fold. Furthermore, chronic exposure to OHB potentiated vanadate's action, resulting in a 250% increase in enzyme activation compared to control cells. Though OHB induced a 2.1-fold increase of basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation, inhibition of this enzyme with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 demonstrated that ERK1/2 did not participate in OHB-induced insulin resistance. In conclusion, ketone bodies promote insulin resistance probably through decreased activation of the PI3-K/PKB signaling cascade. Furthermore, vanadate can bypass insulin resistance and stimulate glucose uptake in OHB-treated cardiomyocytes.",0,Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-200 g),animal,Animal – Rat,"protein degradation, down",Cell Death & Survival,small intestine,Small intestine,enterocytes,Epithelial – Gastrointestinal,Intestinal enterocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",20 mmol/L beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
17115265,Effect of energy substrates on protein degradation in isolated small intestinal enterocytes from rats.,"BACKGROUND: Nutrients affect small intestinal protein mass and metabolism, but studies on the effect of nutrients on small intestinal protein degradation are very limited due to a lack of a proper method. The objectives of this study were to establish a method to directly estimate protein degradation in isolated enterocytes from rats and to test the effect of energy substrates on protein degradation. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-200 g, n>or=8 per treatment) were used. Cell viability, tyrosine release as an indicator of protein degradation, and the effect of osmolarity, 50 mmol/L glucose, 20 mmol/L beta-hydroxybutyrate, 4.7 mmol/L butyrate, and 30 mmol/L glutamine on protein degradation were measured. RESULTS: The average viability of enterocytes at time 30 minutes was 85.8% (range, 81%-94%). Tyrosine release was linear over the course of experiments, indicating constant protein degradation (R2=0.9943; p<.05). Osmolarity, glucose, and glutamine had no effect on protein degradation in isolated enterocytes. Beta-hydroxybutyrate significantly decreased it (-16%; p<.05), whereas butyrate slightly increased it (+5%; p<.05). CONCLUSIONS: A high viability and constant protein degradation indicate a successful establishment of a method to estimate protein degradation in isolated small intestinal enterocytes from rats. The large effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate suggests a potential positive role for ketone bodies to limit the loss of small intestinal protein mass by decreasing protein degradation.",0,rats; IOA-treated rats; glutamate intrastriatal injection,animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Other Mammal,"lipoperoxidation, down",Metabolic Regulation,striatum,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Glutamate toxicity,Toxicology / Poisoning,"neuronal damage, down","Neuronal survival, down",D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

It involves oxidative stress and is highly facilitated during impairment of energy metabolism. We have shown previously that in vivo systemic glycolysis inhibition with iodoacetate (IOA), exacerbates glutamate excitotoxicity. We have now investigated whether this effect involves oxidative damage to membrane lipids, as evaluated by the presence of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. We have also tested whether the ketone body, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB), prevents lipoperoxidation and tissue damage. Results show that glutamate intrastriatal injection in control rats transiently enhances lipoperoxidation, while in IOA-treated animals increased lipoperoxidation is sustained. Treatment with D-BHB significantly reduces striatal lesions and lipoperoxidation. Vitamin E also reduced neuronal damage and lipoperoxidation. Results suggest that glycolysis impairment favors a pro-oxidant condition and situates oxidative damage as an important mediator of in vivo induced excitotoxicity. Results provide evidence for the neuroprotective effect of D-BHB against glutamate toxicity.",0; MAPK14,cardiomyocytes,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"AMPK/p38 MAPK signaling, down",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,cardiomyocytes,Muscle – Cardiac,Cardiomyocytes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Cardiomyopathy,Cardiovascular,"cardiac glucose uptake, down","Glucose uptake, down",OHB,NS,NS
17240074,Ketone bodies alter dinitrophenol-induced glucose uptake through AMPK inhibition and oxidative stress generation in adult cardiomyocytes.,"In aerobic conditions, the heart preferentially oxidizes fatty acids. However, during metabolic stress, glucose becomes the major energy source, and enhanced glucose uptake has a protective effect on heart function and cardiomyocyte survival. Thus abnormal regulation of glucose uptake may contribute to the development of cardiac disease in diabetics. Ketone bodies are often elevated in poorly controlled diabetics and are associated with increased cellular oxidative stress. Thus we sought to determine the effect of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHB) on cardiac glucose uptake during metabolic stress. We used 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), an uncoupler of the mitochondrial oxidative chain, to mimic hypoxia in cardiomyocytes. Our data demonstrated that chronic exposure to OHB provoked a concentration-dependent decrease of DNP action, resulting in 56% inhibition of DNP-mediated glucose uptake at 5 mM OHB. This was paralleled by a diminution of DNP-mediated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Chronic exposure to OHB also increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by 1.9-fold compared with control cells. To further understand the role of ROS in OHB action, cardiomyocytes were incubated with H(2)O(2). Our results demonstrated that this treatment diminished DNP-induced glucose uptake without altering activation of the AMPK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Incubation with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine partially restored DNP-mediated glucose but not AMPK/p38 MAPK activation. In conclusion, these results suggest that ketone bodies, through inhibition of the AMPK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway and ROS overproduction, regulate DNP action and thus cardiac glucose uptake. Altered glucose uptake in hyperketonemic states during metabolic stress may contribute to diabetic cardiomyopathy.",0,rat neocortical neurons; acutely isolated mitochondria,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"NAD+/NADH ratio increase, up",Multiple mechanisms,neocortex,Brain/CNS,neocortical neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Glutamate excitotoxicity,Neurodegenerative,"neuronal death, down","Neuronal survival, down",combination of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate (1 mM each),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
17369104,Ketones inhibit mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species production following glutamate excitotoxicity by increasing NADH oxidation.,"Dietary protocols that increase serum levels of ketones, such as calorie restriction and the ketogenic diet, offer robust protection against a multitude of acute and chronic neurological diseases. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain unclear. Previous studies have suggested that the ketogenic diet may reduce free radical levels in the brain. Thus, one possibility is that ketones may mediate neuroprotection through antioxidant activity. In the present study, we examined the effects of the ketones beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate on acutely dissociated rat neocortical neurons subjected to glutamate excitotoxicity using cellular electrophysiological and single-cell fluorescence imaging techniques. Further, we explored the effects of ketones on acutely isolated mitochondria exposed to high levels of calcium. A combination of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate (1 mM each) decreased neuronal death and prevented changes in neuronal membrane properties induced by 10 microM glutamate. Ketones also significantly decreased mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species and the associated excitotoxic changes by increasing NADH oxidation in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, but did not affect levels of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione. In conclusion, we demonstrate that ketones reduce glutamate-induced free radical formation by increasing the NAD+/NADH ratio and enhancing mitochondrial respiration in neocortical neurons. This mechanism may, in part, contribute to the neuroprotective activity of ketones by restoring normal bioenergetic function in the face of oxidative stress.",0; CASP3,PC12 cells,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"Bcl-2/Bax mRNA up-regulation, up",Cell Death & Survival,NS,NS,PC12 cells,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Parkinson's disease,Neurodegenerative,"apoptosis, down","Apoptosis, down",NS,NS,D-BHB
17386967,D-beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibits the apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by 6-OHDA in relation to up-regulating the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax mRNA.,"D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DbetaHB) is a predominant member of ketone bodies produced by hepatocytes and, to a lesser extent, by astrocytes. It is an alternative source of energy in the brain when glucose supply is depleted such as during starvation. It has been reported that ketone bodies could protect dopaminergic culture. However, the biological function of DbetaHB in Parkinson disease (PD) is still unclear. In the present work, we investigated the role of DbetaHB in protecting rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells from apoptosis induced by 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). DbetaHB rescued PC12 cells from apoptotic death induced by 6-OHDA by MTT assay, acridine orange (AO) staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and the activity of caspase-3. DbetaHB prevented the decrease of cell viability and the increase of caspase-3 activity induced by 6-OHDA in a dose-dependent manner in PC12 cells. AO and TUNEL staining showed that DbetaHB prevented the apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by 6-OHDA. The ratio of Bcl-2/Bax at mRNA levels, which regulates the apoptosis of PC12 cells when exposed to 6-OHDA, increased when DbetaHB was preincubated. The data showed that DbetaHB inhibited the apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by 6-OHDA in relation to up-regulating the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax mRNA.",0,Sprague Dawley rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketone Ringer's (KR),Multi-source,NS
17409226,Differential effect of resuscitation on Toll-like receptors in a model of hemorrhagic shock without a septic challenge.,"It has been shown that the inflammatory response and cellular damage after hemorrhagic shock are influenced by resuscitation strategies. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in signal transduction in inflammatory conditions. However, alterations in TLR expression following hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation have not been well documented. This study was conducted to measure the impact of different resuscitation strategies on TLR expression and downstream signaling in key organs. METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats (n=38) were subjected to a severe volume-controlled hemorrhage protocol. After 75 min of shock, they were resuscitated over 45 min as follows: (1) lactated Ringer's (LR, 81 ml/kg), (2) ketone Ringer's (KR, 81 ml/kg), (3) 7.5% hypertonic saline (HTS, 9.7 ml/kg), (4) 6% hetastarch (HEX, 27 ml/kg), (5) pyruvate Ringer's (PR, 81 ml/kg). Sham hemorrhage (NH) and no resuscitation (NR) groups served as controls. The KR and PR solutions were identical to LR except for equimolar substitution of racemic lactate with beta hydroxybutyrate and sodium pyruvate, respectively. At the end of resuscitation, the expression of TLRs (types 1-10), and cytokines (IL-10, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) were measured in the lung and spleen using RT-PCR. Levels of phosphorylated and total IkB-alpha and NF-kappaB were detected by Western blotting. The systemic and lung protein levels of TNF-alpha were measured using ELISA and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Expression of TLRs in the lung was affected more than in the spleen by hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation. In the lung, hemorrhage increased TLR-2, -3 and -6 (but not TLR-4) mRNA expression, with an up-regulation of the ratio of phosphor-NF-kappaBp65 and total NF-kappaBp65, NF-kappaBp65 activation, and enhanced systemic and tissue TNF-alpha protein levels. Post-resuscitation, TLR mRNA profile and subsequent downstream proteins in the lung and spleen were affected by the choice of resuscitation strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic shock activates TLR signaling in lung, but not the spleen, probably through an up-regulation of TLR gene expression, and activation of NF-kappaB pathway.

We have tested for an acute effect of physiological ketone bodies on neuronal firing rates and excitability, to discover possible therapeutic mechanisms of the ketogenic diet. Physiological concentrations of ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate) reduced the spontaneous firing rate of neurons in slices from rat or mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata. This region is thought to act as a ""seizure gate,"" controlling seizure generalization. Consistent with an anticonvulsant role, the ketone body effect is larger for cells that fire more rapidly. The effect of ketone bodies was abolished by eliminating the metabolically sensitive K(ATP) channels pharmacologically or by gene knock-out.

The cause is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to study a pair of homozygotic twin boys, one of whom had severe KH from the age of 14 months, whereas the other boy was apparently healthy. DESIGN AND RESULTS: At the age of 6 yr, the boys were thoroughly investigated. During a 24-h fasting tolerance test, the twin with KH showed hypoglycemia (blood glucose 2.0 mmol/liter) after 18 h. Three h before the occurrence of hypoglycemia, he had had 10 times higher beta-hydroxybutyrate levels than his brother, who showed no signs of hypoglycemia. Their glucose production rates were normal and similar (23.3 and 21.7 micromol/kg body weight per minute in the healthy and KH twin, respectively) as well as their lipolysis rates (5.8 and 6.8 micromol/kg body weight per minute, respectively). During repeated 60-min infusions of beta-hydroxybutyrate, the plasma level of beta-hydroxybutyrate increased 5-10 times more in the twin with KH (mean 1.1 mmol/liter in the healthy and 10.8 mmol/liter in the KH twin), indicating a disturbed clearance or metabolism of beta-hydroxybutyrate. No mutations were found in genes involved in ketone body metabolism or transport. CONCLUSION: In the affected boy, KH seems to be the result of a reduced capacity to use ketone bodies, leading to increased peripheral metabolism of glucose that cannot be met by hepatic glucose production. Because the boys are homozygotic twins and only one of them is affected, the ketotic hypoglycemia is most likely caused by an altered imprinting of gene(s) involved in regulating metabolic pathways.",0; KAT2A; HAT1; EP300; FOS; MYC; HSPA1A,Yorkshire swine,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"histone acetylation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,chromatin,Nucleus & Chromatin,Chromatin,Hemorrhage,Injury & Trauma,"NS, nan","NS, nan",Ketone Ringer's (KR) (equimolar substitution of lactate with beta-hydroxybutyrate),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
17904939,Impact of resuscitation strategies on the acetylation status of cardiac histones in a swine model of hemorrhage.,"BACKGROUND: Chromatin remodeling through histone acetylation is a key control mechanism in gene transcription. We have shown previously that fluid resuscitation in rodents is coupled with highly structured post-translational modifications of cardiac histones. The current experiment was performed to validate this concept in a clinically relevant large animal model of hemorrhage and resuscitation, and to correlate the changes in histone acetylation with altered expression of immediate-early response genes. STUDY DESIGN: Yorkshire swine (n=49, 7/group, weight=40-58kg) were subjected to combined uncontrolled and controlled hemorrhage (40% of estimated blood volume) and randomly assigned to the following resuscitation groups: (1) 0.9% saline (NS), (2) racemic lactated Ringer's (dl-LR), (3) l-isomer lactated Ringer's (l-LR), (4) Ketone Ringer's (KR), (5) 6% hetastarch in saline (Hespan). KR contained an equimolar substitution of lactate with beta-hydroxybutyrate. No hemorrhage (NH) and no resuscitation (NR) groups were included as controls. Cardiac protein was used in Western blotting to analyze total protein acetylation and histone acetylation specifically. Lysine residue-specific acetylation of histone subunits H3 and H4 was further evaluated. In addition, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technique was used to separate the DNA bound to acetylated histones (H3 and H4 subunits), followed by measurement of genes that are altered by hemorrhage/resuscitation, including immediate-early response genes (c-fos and c-myc), and heat shock protein (HSP) 70. RESULTS: The type of fluid used for resuscitation influenced the patterns of cardiac histone acetylation. Resuscitation with dl-LR and KR induced hyperacetylation on H3K9. KR resuscitation was also associated with increased acetylation on H3K14 and H4K5, and hypoacetylation on H3K18. The expression of genes was also fluid specific, with the largest number of changes following KR resuscitation (increased c-fos and c-myc, HSP 70 linked with H3; and increased c-myc linked with H4). Among the histone subunits studied, altered H3 acetylations were associated with the majority of changes in immediate-early gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Acetylation status of cardiac histones, affected by hemorrhage, is further modulated by resuscitation producing a fluid-specific code that is preserved in different species. Resuscitation with KR causes histone acetylation at the largest number of lysine sites (predominately H3 subunit), and has the most pronounced impact on the transcriptional regulation of selected (immediate-early response) genes.",0,untrained overweight adults,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"fatigability, up",Other / Unspecified,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"perceived exercise effort, up; fatigue, up; total mood disturbance, up; weight loss, no-change","Exercise capacity, up; Fatigue, up; Mood disturbance, up; Body weight, no-change",ketogenic low-carbohydrate diet,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

To explore whether popular low-carbohydrate diets might impact the desire to exercise by raising blood ketone concentrations, fatigue and perceived effort during exercise were compared in untrained, overweight adults adhering to a ketogenic low-carbohydrate diet or to a control diet low in carbohydrate, but not ketogenic (5%, 65%, and 30% or 40%, 30%, and 30% of energy from carbohydrate, fat, and protein, respectively). In this prospective, randomized, 2-week pilot study, all meals and snacks were provided to subjects, and energy intake was strictly controlled to provide approximately 70% of that needed for weight maintenance. At baseline and at the end of week 2, exercise testing was conducted in fasting participants. Weight loss and the reductions in fat mass did not differ by group during the trial. At week 2, blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were 3.6-fold greater for the ketogenic vs nonketogenic group (P=0.018) and correlated significantly with perceived exercise effort (r2=0.22, P=0.049). Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate was also significantly correlated to feelings of ""fatigue"" (r=0.458, P=0.049) and to ""total mood disturbance"" (r=0.551, P=0.015) while exercising.

18160486,"Inhibition of agouti-related peptide expression by glucose in a clonal hypothalamic neuronal cell line is mediated by glycolysis, not oxidative phosphorylation.","The regulation of neuroendocrine electrical activity and gene expression by glucose is mediated through several distinct metabolic pathways. Many studies have implicated AMP and ATP as key metabolites mediating neuroendocrine responses to glucose, especially through their effects on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but other studies have suggested that glycolysis, and in particular the cytoplasmic conversion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to reduced NAD (NADH), may play a more important role than oxidative phosphorylation for some effects of glucose. To address these molecular mechanisms further, we have examined the regulation of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) in a clonal hypothalamic cell line, N-38. AgRP expression was induced monotonically as glucose concentrations decreased from 10 to 0.5 mm glucose and with increasing concentrations of glycolytic inhibitors. However, neither pyruvate nor 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate mimicked the effect of glucose to reduce AgRP mRNA, but on the contrary, produced the opposite effect of glucose and actually increased AgRP mRNA. Nevertheless, 3beta-hydroxybutyrate mimicked the effect of glucose to increase ATP and to decrease AMPK phosphorylation. Similarly, inhibition of AMPK by RNA interference increased, and activation of AMPK decreased, AgRP mRNA. Additional studies demonstrated that neither the hexosamine nor the pentose/carbohydrate response element-binding protein pathways mediate the effects of glucose on AgRP expression. These studies do not support that either ATP or AMPK mediate effects of glucose on AgRP in this hypothalamic cell line but support a role for glycolysis and, in particular, NADH. These studies support that cytoplasmic or nuclear NADH, uniquely produced by glucose metabolism, mediates effects of glucose on AgRP expression.",INS,INS-1 832/13 cells; rat pancreatic islets; isolated mitochondria,animal; in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line; Animal – Rat; NS,"anaplerosis, up",Metabolic Regulation,pancreatic islets,Pancreas,INS-1 832/13 cells,Pancreatic Endocrine,β-cells (islet),mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"insulin release, up","Insulin secretion, up",NS,NS,NS
18189272,Acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate in combination with other metabolites release insulin from INS-1 cells and provide clues about pathways in insulin secretion.,"Mitochondrial anaplerosis is important for insulin secretion, but only some of the products of anaplerosis are known. We discovered novel effects of mitochondrial metabolites on insulin release in INS-1 832/13 cells that suggested pathways to some of these products. Acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC), and monomethyl succinate (MMS) alone did not stimulate insulin release. Lactate released very little insulin. When acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, or KIC were combined with MMS, or either ketone body was combined with lactate, insulin release was stimulated 10-fold to 20-fold the controls (almost as much as with glucose). Pyruvate was a potent stimulus of insulin release. In rat pancreatic islets, beta-hydroxybutyrate potentiated MMS- and glucose-induced insulin release. The pathways of their metabolism suggest that, in addition to producing ATP, the ketone bodies and KIC supply the acetate component and MMS supplies the oxaloacetate component of citrate. In line with this, citrate was increased by beta-hydroxybutyrate plus MMS in INS-1 cells and by beta-hydroxybutyrate plus succinate in mitochondria. The two ketone bodies and KIC can also be metabolized to acetoacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, which are precursors of other short-chain acyl-CoAs (SC-CoAs). Measurements of SC-CoAs by LC-MS/MS in INS-1 cells confirmed that KIC, beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, and pyruvate increased the levels of acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA. MMS increased incorporation of (14)C from beta-hydroxybutyrate into citrate, acid-precipitable material, and lipids, suggesting that the two molecules complement one another to increase anaplerosis. The results suggest that, besides citrate, some of the products of anaplerosis are SC-CoAs, which may be precursors of molecules involved in insulin secretion.",0,NRK-49F cells; UUO rats,animal; in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line; Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,renal interstitium,Kidney,normal rat kidney interstitial fibroblast,Stromal / Mesenchymal,Fibroblasts,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Renal fibrosis,Renal & Urological,"fibrosis, up","Fibrosis, up",NS,NS,NS

Hence, developing agents that antagonize fibrogenic signals is a critical issue facing researchers. The present study investigated the blood-circulation-promoting Chinese herb, safflower, on fibrosis status in NRK-49F cells, a normal rat kidney interstitial fibroblast, to evaluate the underlying signal transduction mechanism of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), a potent fibrogenic growth factor. Safflower was characterized and extracted using water. Renal fibrosis model was established both in vitro with fibroblast cells treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate and in vivo using rats undergone unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Western blotting was used to examine protein expression in TGF-beta-related signal proteins such as type I and type II TGF-beta receptor, Smads2/3, pSmad2/3, Smads4, and Smads7. ELISA was used to analyze bioactive TGF-beta1 and fibronectin levels in the culture media. Safflower extract (SE) significantly inhibited beta-HB-induced fibrosis in NRK cells concomitantly with dose-dependent inhibition of the type I TGF-beta1 receptor and its down-stream signals (i.e., Smad). Moreover, SE dose-dependently enhanced inhibitory Smad7. Thus, SE can suppress renal cellular fibrosis by inhibiting the TGF-beta autocrine loop. Moreover, remarkably lower levels of tissue collagen were noted in the nephron and serum TGF-beta1 of UUO rats receiving oral SE (0.15 g/3 ml/0.25 kg/day) compared with the untreated controls. Hence, SE is a potential inhibitor of renal fibrosis.

18439432,Antioxidant capacity contributes to protection of ketone bodies against oxidative damage induced during hypoglycemic conditions.,"Ketone bodies play a key role in mammalian energy metabolism during the suckling period. Normally ketone bodies' blood concentration during adulthood is very low, although it can rise during starvation, an exogenous infusion or a ketogenic diet. Whenever ketone bodies' levels increase, their oxidation in the brain rises. For this reason they have been used as protective molecules against refractory epilepsy and in experimental models of ischemia and excitotoxicity. The mechanisms underlying the protective effect of these compounds are not completely understood. Here, we studied a possible antioxidant capacity of ketone bodies and whether it contributes to the protection against oxidative damage induced during hypoglycemia. We report for the first time the scavenging capacity of the ketone bodies, acetoacetate (AcAc) and both the physiological and non-physiological isomers of beta-hydroxybutyrate (D- and L-BHB, respectively), for diverse reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hydroxyl radicals (.OH) were effectively scavenged by D- and L-BHB. In addition, the three ketone bodies were able to reduce cell death and ROS production induced by the glycolysis inhibitor, iodoacetate (IOA), while only D-BHB and AcAc prevented neuronal ATP decline. Finally, in an in vivo model of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, the administration of D- or L-BHB, but not of AcAc, was able to prevent the hypoglycemia-induced increase in lipid peroxidation in the rat hippocampus. Our data suggest that the antioxidant capacity contributes to protection of ketone bodies against oxidative damage in in vitro and in vivo models associated with free radical production and energy impairment.",0,rat pancreatic islets; INS-1 cells; ATP citrate lyase-deficient INS-1 cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"acetoacetate-transferred acyl carbon, up",Other / Unspecified,pancreatic islets,Pancreas,INS-1 cells,Pancreatic Endocrine,β-cells (islet),mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"insulin release, up","Insulin secretion, up",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
18565731,"Studies with leucine, beta-hydroxybutyrate and ATP citrate lyase-deficient beta cells support the acetoacetate pathway of insulin secretion.","We hypothesized that contrasting leucine with its non-metabolizable analog 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) might provide new information about metabolic pathways involved in insulin secretion. Both compounds stimulate insulin secretion by allosterically activating glutamate dehydrogenase, which enhances glutamate metabolism. However, we found that leucine was a stronger secretagogue in rat pancreatic islets and INS-1 cells. This suggested that leucine's metabolism contributed to its insulinotropism. Indeed, we found that leucine increased acetoacetate and was metabolized to CO(2) in pancreatic islets and increased short chain acyl-CoAs (SC-CoAs) in INS-1 cells. We then used the leucine-BCH difference to study the hypothesis that acyl groups derived from secretagogue carbon can be transferred as acetoacetate, in addition to citrate, from mitochondria to the cytosol where they can be converted to SC-CoAs. Since BCH cannot form sufficient acetoacetate from glutamate, transport of any glutamate-derived acyl groups to the cytosol in BCH-stimulated cells must proceed mainly via citrate. In ATP citrate lyase-deficient INS-1 cells, which are unable to convert citrate into cytosolic acetyl-CoA, insulin release by BCH was decreased and adding beta-hydroxybutyrate or alpha-ketoisocaproate, which increases mitochondrial acetoacetate, normalized BCH-induced insulin release. This strengthens the concept that acetoacetate-transferred acyl carbon can be converted to cytosolic SC-CoAs to stimulate insulin secretion.",0,CD1 mice; C3H mice; 6-Hz model; fluorothyl model; pentylenetetrazole model; kainate model,animal,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Rat; Animal – Other Mammal,"plasma d-BHB, up",Metabolic Regulation,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"anticonvulsant effect, up (6-Hz model); anticonvulsant effect, no-change (fluorothyl model; pentylenetetrazole model, nan; kainate model hippocampus), nan","Seizure protection, up (6-Hz model); Seizure protection, no-change (fluorothyl model; Seizure activity, nan; Brain injury, nan",4:1 and 6:1 KDs,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),D-BHB

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of balanced ketogenic and control diets in acute mouse seizure models. The behavior in four mouse seizure models, plasma d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (d-BHB) and glucose levels were determined after feeding control diet, 4:1 and 6:1 KDs with matched vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Feeding 4:1 and 6:1 KDs ad lib to 3-week-old (adolescent) mice resulted in 1.2-2.2mM d-BHB in plasma, but did not consistently change glucose levels. The 6:1 KD reproducibly elevated the CC50 (current that initiates seizures in 50% mice tested) in the 6-Hz model after 14 days of feeding to adolescent CD1 mice. Higher plasma d-BHB levels correlated with anticonvulsant effects. Despite ketosis, no consistent anticonvulsant effects of KDs were found in the fluorothyl or pentylenetetrazole CD1 mouse models. The 4:1 KD was neither anticonvulsant nor neuroprotective in hippocampus in the C3H mouse kainate model. Taken together, the KD's anticonvulsant effect was limited to the 6-Hz model, required chronic feeding with 6:1 fat content, and was independent from lowering plasma glucose.",0,rats; CA1 pyramidal neurons; brain protein extracts,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"antioxidant mechanism, up",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,CA1 pyramidal neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation,Neurodegenerative,"long-term potentiation, up","Long-term potentiation, up",combination of ACA and BHB (1 mM each),In vitro media supplementation,NS

In the present study, we explored the effects of the KB acetoacetate (ACA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rats by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) using electrophysiological, fluorescence imaging, and enzyme assay techniques. We found that: 1) a combination of ACA and BHB (1 mM each) prevented impairment of LTP by H(2)O(2) (200 microM); 2) KB significantly lowered intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)--measured with the fluorescent indicator carboxy-H(2)DCFDA (carboxy-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate)--in CA1 pyramidal neurons exposed to H(2)O(2); 3) the effect of KB on LTP was replicated by the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor fostriecin; 4) KB prevented impairment of LTP by the PP2A activator C(6) ceramide; 5) fostriecin did not prevent the increase in ROS levels in CA1 pyramidal neurons exposed to H(2)O(2), and C(6) ceramide did not increase ROS levels; 6) PP2A activity was enhanced by both H(2)O(2) and rotenone (a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor that increases endogenous superoxide production); and 7) KB inhibited PP2A activity in protein extracts from brain tissue treated with either H(2)O(2) or ceramide. We propose that oxidative impairment of hippocampal LTP is associated with PP2A activation, and that KB prevent this impairment in part by inducing PP2A inhibition through an antioxidant mechanism.",HIF1A; BCL2,reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO); ketogenic diet (3 weeks); intraventricular BHB infusion (4 days),animal,Animal – Other Mammal; Human – Interventional,"succinate elevation, up",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Stroke,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"infarct volume, down","Infarct size, down",intraventricular infusion; diet-induced ketosis,NS; Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

The rationale that the utilization of ketones by the brain results in elevation of intracellular succinate, a known inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase (the enzyme responsible for the degradation of HIF-1alpha) was deemed as a potential mechanism of ketosis on the upregulation of HIF-1alpha. The neuroprotective effect of diet-induced ketosis (3 weeks of feeding a ketogenic diet), as pretreatment, on infarct volume, after reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and the upregulation of HIF-1alpha were investigated. The effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), as a pretreatment, via intraventricular infusion (4 days of infusion before stroke) was also investigated following MCAO. Levels of HIF-1alpha and Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) proteins and succinate content were measured. A 55% or 70% reduction in infarct volume was observed with BHB infusion or diet-induced ketosis, respectively. The levels of HIF-1alpha and Bcl-2 proteins increased threefold with diet-induced ketosis; BHB infusions also resulted in increases in these proteins. As hypothesized, succinate content increased by 55% with diet-induced ketosis and fourfold with BHB infusion. In conclusion, the biochemical link between ketosis and the stabilization of HIF-1alpha is through the elevation of succinate, and both HIF-1alpha stabilization and Bcl-2 upregulation play a role in ketone-induced neuroprotection in the brain.",0; SOD1; CAT,developing rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"pro-oxidant activity, no-change; antioxidant activity, no-change",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,cerebral cortex,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
19052316,Influence of ketone bodies on oxidative stress parameters in brain of developing rats in vitro.,"Pro-oxidant and antioxidant properties have been found for acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in peripheral tissues. In the present study we investigated the role of AcAc and BHB at concentrations found in diabetic patients during ketoacidotic crises and in individuals affected by succinyl CoA: 3-oxoacid CoA transferase and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase deficiencies, disorders clinically characterized by neurological symptoms, on a large number of oxidative stress parameters in fresh cerebral cortex of developing rats. Lipid peroxidation (chemiluminescence and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances levels), protein oxidative damage (carbonyl formation and sulfhydryl oxidation), 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate oxidation and the non-enzymatic (total antioxidant reactivity and glutathione levels) and enzymatic (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities) antioxidant defenses were not changed by doses of BHB and AcAc as high as 25 mM in cortical supernatants under basal conditions. Furthermore, BHB did not affect the increased thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances levels provoked by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric and 3-methylglutaconic acids and by a hydroxyl-induced generation system. Finally, BHB and AcAc were not able to oxidize sulfhydryl groups from a commercial GSH solution. Therefore, under basal conditions or under situations with high production of free radicals, AcAc and BHB were not able to reduce or increase the oxidative stress parameters in the brain. Taken together, our present results do not support the hypothesis that BHB and AcAc act as potent direct or indirect pro-oxidants or antioxidants in the CNS.",SLC16A1,Spermophilus tridecemlineatus (thirteen-lined ground squirrel),animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"MCT1 upregulation, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",13C-labeled BHB,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

We found serum levels of the fat-derived ketone, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), are highest during deep torpor and exist in a reciprocal relationship with glucose throughout the hibernation season in the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus). Ketone transporter monocarboxylic acid transporter 1 (MCT1) is upregulated at the blood-brain barrier, as animals enter hibernation. Uptake and metabolism of 13C-labeled BHB and glucose were measured by high-resolution NMR in both brain and heart at several different body temperatures ranging from 7 to 38 degrees C. We show that BHB and glucose enter the heart and brain under conditions of depressed body temperature and heart rate but that their utilization as a fuel is highly selective. During arousal from torpor, glucose enters the brain over a wide range of body temperatures, but metabolism is minimal, as only low levels of labeled metabolites are detected. This is in contrast to BHB, which not only enters the brain but is also metabolized via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. A similar situation is seen in the heart as both glucose and BHB are transported into the organ, but only 13C from BHB enters the TCA cycle. This finding suggests that fuel selection is controlled at the level of individual metabolic pathways and that seasonally induced adaptive mechanisms give rise to the strategic utilization of BHB during hibernation.",ADIPOQ,rats; primary adipocytes; 3T3-L1 adipocytes; wild-type mice; GPR109A receptor knockout mice,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells; In vitro – Immortalized cell line; Animal – Mouse,"GPR109A receptor-dependent, up",Other / Unspecified,adipose tissue,Adipose tissue,adipocytes,Adipose,White adipocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"adiponectin secretion, up","Adiponectin secretion, up",an endogenous ligand of the GPR109A receptor,NS,NS
19223595,Niacin stimulates adiponectin secretion through the GPR109A receptor.,"Niacin (nicotinic acid) has recently been shown to increase serum adiponectin concentrations in men with the metabolic syndrome. However, little is known about the mechanism(s) by which niacin regulates the intracellular trafficking and secretion of adiponectin. Since niacin appears to exert its effects on lipolysis through receptor (GPR109A)-dependent and -independent pathways, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the role of the recently identified GPR109A receptor in adiponectin secretion. Initial in vivo studies in rats demonstrated that niacin (30 mg/kg po) acutely increases serum adiponectin concentrations, whereas it decreases NEFAs. Further in vitro studies demonstrated an increase in adiponectin secretion and a decrease in lipolysis in primary adipocytes following treatment with niacin or beta-hydroxybutyrate (an endogenous ligand of the GPR109A receptor), but these effects were blocked when adipocytes were pretreated with pertussis toxin. Niacin had no effect on adiponectin secretion or lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which have limited cell surface expression of the GPR109A receptor. To further substantiate these in vitro findings, wild-type and GPR109A receptor knockout mice were administered a single dose of niacin or placebo, and serum was obtained for the determination of adiponectin and NEFA concentrations. Serum adiponectin concentrations increased and serum NEFAs decreased in the wild-type mice within 10 min following niacin administration. However, niacin administration had no effect on adiponectin and NEFA concentrations in the GPR109A receptor knockout mice. These results demonstrate that the GPR109A receptor plays an important role in the dual regulation of adiponectin secretion and lipolysis.",0,intensively treated type 1 diabetic subjects; rat hippocampal slice preparations,human; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Multi-model,"synaptic transmission, up",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypoglycemia,Metabolic & Endocrine,"cognition, up","Cognition, up",medium-chain triglycerides,MCT / Medium-chain fats,NS
19223991,Medium-chain fatty acids improve cognitive function in intensively treated type 1 diabetic patients and support in vitro synaptic transmission during acute hypoglycemia.,"OBJECTIVE: We examined whether ingestion of medium-chain triglycerides could improve cognition during hypoglycemia in subjects with intensively treated type 1 diabetes and assessed potential underlying mechanisms by testing the effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate and octanoate on rat hippocampal synaptic transmission during exposure to low glucose. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 11 intensively treated type 1 diabetic subjects participated in stepped hyperinsulinemic- (2 mU x kg(-1) x min(-1)) euglycemic- (glucose approximately 5.5 mmol/l) hypoglycemic (glucose approximately 2.8 mmol/l) clamp studies. During two separate sessions, they randomly received either medium-chain triglycerides or placebo drinks and performed a battery of cognitive tests. In vitro rat hippocampal slice preparations were used to assess the ability of beta-hydroxybutyrate and octanoate to support neuronal activity when glucose levels are reduced. RESULTS: Hypoglycemia impaired cognitive performance in tests of verbal memory, digit symbol coding, digit span backwards, and map searching. Ingestion of medium-chain triglycerides reversed these effects. Medium-chain triglycerides also produced higher free fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels compared with placebo. However, the increase in catecholamines and symptoms during hypoglycemia was not altered. In hippocampal slices beta-hydroxybutyrate supported synaptic transmission under low-glucose conditions, whereas octanoate could not. Nevertheless, octanoate improved the rate of recovery of synaptic function upon restoration of control glucose concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Medium-chain triglyceride ingestion improves cognition without adversely affecting adrenergic or symptomatic responses to hypoglycemia in intensively treated type 1 diabetic subjects. Medium-chain triglycerides offer the therapeutic advantage of preserving brain function under hypoglycemic conditions without causing deleterious hyperglycemia.",HCAR2; 0,mouse retina; ARPE-19; RGC-5; rMC-1; primary mouse RPE,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line; Multi-model,"GPR109A activation, up",Inflammation & Immune Response,retina,Eye/Retina,RPE,Epithelial – Skin & Eye,Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE),basolateral membrane,Plasma Membrane,Basolateral membrane,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
19227486,Expression and localization of GPR109A (PUMA-G/HM74A) mRNA and protein in mammalian retinal pigment epithelium.,"PURPOSE: GPR109A has been identified as a G-protein-coupled receptor for niacin. beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) is a physiologic ligand for the receptor. beta-HB, the predominate ketone body in circulation, is an important energy source for neurons, including retinal neurons, under various physiologic and pathologic conditions. The identification of GPR109A as the receptor for beta-HB suggests additional, hitherto unknown, functions for this metabolite. The circulating levels of beta-HB increase in diabetes. Since retinopathy is a serious complication associated with diabetes, we investigated GPR109A expression in retina and in different retinal cell types to determine if the receptor may have a role in the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: RT-PCR, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescent techniques were used to analyze GPR109A expression in mouse retina and in three transformed retinal cell lines: ARPE-19 (RPE), RGC-5 (ganglion), and rMC-1 (Muller). Activation of GPR109A by niacin and beta-HB was demonstrated in ARPE-19 cells by cAMP assay. RESULTS: Studies conducted using mouse retinal tissues demonstrated that GPR109A is expressed in retina with its expression restricted to RPE, where it differentially polarizes to the basolateral membrane. These results were confirmed with cell lines, which demonstrated GPR109A expression in ARPE-19, but not in rMC-1 and RGC-5 cells. Primary cultures of mouse RPE also showed robust expression of GPR109A. cAMP assay demonstrated that GPR109A expressed in RPE is functional. CONCLUSIONS: These data represent the first report on GPR109A expression in retina. The exclusive expression of GPR109A in RPE basolateral membrane, which has access to beta-HB in blood, may have biologic importance in diabetic retinopathy.",0,control rats; ketotic rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"CMRGlu, down",Metabolic Regulation,frontal cortex; cerebellum,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"glucose consumption, down","Glucose utilization, down",plasma BHB concentration,NS,NS
19285044,Ketones suppress brain glucose consumption.,"The brain is dependent on glucose as a primary energy substrate, but is capable of utilizing ketones such as beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta HB) and acetoacetate (AcAc), as occurs with fasting, prolonged starvation or chronic feeding of a high fat/low carbohydrate diet (ketogenic diet). In this study, the local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose consumption (CMRglu; microM/min/100g) was calculated in the cortex and cerebellum of control and ketotic rats using Patlak analysis. Rats were imaged on a rodent PET scanner and MRI was performed on a 7-Tesla Bruker scanner for registration with the PET images. Plasma glucose and beta HB concentrations were measured and 90-minute dynamic PET scans were started simultaneously with bolus injection of 2-Deoxy-2[18F]Fluoro-D-Glucose (FDG). The blood radioactivity concentration was automatically sampled from the tail vein for 3 min following injection and manual periodic blood samples were taken. The calculated local CMRGlu decreased with increasing plasma BHB concentration in the cerebellum (CMRGlu = -4.07*[BHB] + 61.4, r2 = 0.3) and in the frontal cortex (CMRGlu = -3.93*[BHB] + 42.7, r2 = 0.5).

19300863,Beta-hydroxybutyrate alters GABA-transaminase activity in cultured astrocytes.,"The ketogenic diet has long been recognized as an effective treatment for medically refractory epilepsy. Despite nearly a century of use, the mechanisms underlying its clinical efficacy remain unknown. One of the proposed hypotheses for its anti-epileptic actions involves increased GABA concentration in the brain due to ketone bodies that become elevated with a ketogenic diet. In recent years, the notion that astrocytes could play a role in the evolution of abnormal cortical excitability in chronic neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, has received renewed attention. The present study examined the effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body, on GABA metabolism in rat primary cultured astrocytes. When beta-hydroxybutyrate was added to culture medium, GABA-transaminase (GABA-T) mRNA expression was significantly suppressed in time- and dose-dependent manners. GABA-T enzymatic activity in beta-hydroxybutyrate-treated astrocytes was also suppressed, in accordance with its gene expression. These effects were evident after 3 days of culture, which might coincide with depleted intracellular glycogen. GABA transporter, GAT-1, gene expression was strongly suppressed in cultured astrocytes after 5 days of culture with beta-hydroxybutyrate, although other type of GABA transporters did not display significant changes. These results suggest that beta-hydroxybutyrate induced by ketogenic diet may increase GABA concentration in the epileptic brain by suppressing astrocytic GABA degradation, leading to antiepileptic effects.",0,young adults (23 +/- 1 y); middle-aged adults (50 +/- 1 y); elderly adults (76 +/- 2 y),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"beta-hydroxybutyrate oxidation, no-change",Metabolic Regulation,plasma,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketogenic meal,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Healthy subjects in three age groups (23 +/- 1, 50 +/- 1 and 76 +/- 2 y old) were given a ketogenic meal and plasma beta -hydroxybutyrate, glucose, insulin, triacylglycerols, total cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acids and breath acetone were measured over the subsequent 6 h. Each subject completed the protocol twice in order to determine the oxidation of a tracer dose of both carbon-13 (13C) glucose and 13C-beta-hydroxybutyrate. The tracers were given separately in random order. Apolipoprotein E genotype was also determined in all subjects. RESULTS: Plasma glucose decreased and beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetone and insulin increased similarly over 6 h in all three groups after the ketogenic meal. There was no significant change in cholesterol, triacylglycerols or non-esterified fatty acids over the 6 h. 13C-glucose and 13C-beta-hydroxybutyrate oxidation peaked at 2-3 h postdose for all age groups. Cumulative 13C-glucose oxidation over 24 h was significantly higher in the elderly but only versus the middle-aged group. There was no difference in cumulative 13C-beta-hydroxybutyrate oxidation between the three groups. Apolipoprotein E (epsilon 4) was associated with elevated fasting cholesterol but was unrelated to the other plasma metabolites. CONCLUSION: Elderly people in relatively good health have a similar capacity to produce ketones and to oxidize 13C-beta-hydroxybutyrate as middle-aged or young adults, but oxidize 13C-glucose a little more rapidly than healthy middle-aged adults.",0,day-old chicks; one-trial bead discrimination learning,animal,Animal – Other Mammal; NS,"astrocytic oxidative metabolism, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,NS,NS,astrocytes,Neural / Glial,Astrocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"memory consolidation, up","Memory (general), up",ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (injected),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Neurobiol. Aging, in press). Administration of the beta3-adrenergic agonist CL316243, which specifically stimulates astrocytic but not neuronal glucose uptake, rescues Abeta impaired memory. Weakly reinforced training can be consolidated by various metabolic substrates and we have demonstrated neuronal dependence on oxidative metabolism of glucose soon after training versus astrocytic glucose dependence 20 min later. Based on these findings we examined whether different metabolic substrates were able to counteract memory inhibition by Abeta(1-42). Although lactate, the medium-chain fatty acid octanoate, and the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate consolidated weakly reinforced training when injected close to learning, none of them were able to salvage Abeta-impaired memory; at this early time. All three metabolites and the astrocytic-specific acetate consolidated weak learning and rescued Abeta-impaired memory when injected 10-20 min post-training. However, neither glucose nor insulin rescued memory when injected at 20 min. Rescue of memory by providing astrocytes with alternative substrates for oxidative metabolism suggests that Abeta(1-42) exerts its amnestic effects specifically by impairing astrocytic glycolysis.",0,cultured glutamatergic neurons,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"malate-aspartate shuttle activity, down",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,brain,Brain/CNS,glutamatergic neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan","[2,4-(13)C]beta-hydroxybutyrate",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
19664276,Availability of neurotransmitter glutamate is diminished when beta-hydroxybutyrate replaces glucose in cultured neurons.,"Ketone bodies serve as alternative energy substrates for the brain in cases of low glucose availability such as during starvation or in patients treated with a ketogenic diet. The ketone bodies are metabolized via a distinct pathway confined to the mitochondria. We have compared metabolism of [2,4-(13)C]beta-hydroxybutyrate to that of [1,6-(13)C]glucose in cultured glutamatergic neurons and investigated the effect of neuronal activity focusing on the aspartate-glutamate homeostasis, an essential component of the excitatory activity in the brain. The amount of (13)C incorporation and cellular content was lower for glutamate and higher for aspartate in the presence of [2,4-(13)C]beta-hydroxybutyrate as opposed to [1,6-(13)C]glucose. Our results suggest that the change in aspartate-glutamate homeostasis is due to a decreased availability of NADH for cytosolic malate dehydrogenase and thus reduced malate-aspartate shuttle activity in neurons using beta-hydroxybutyrate. In the presence of glucose, the glutamate content decreased significantly upon activation of neurotransmitter release, whereas in the presence of only beta-hydroxybutyrate, no decrease in the glutamate content was observed. Thus, the fraction of the glutamate pool available for transmitter release was diminished when metabolizing beta-hydroxybutyrate, which is in line with the hypothesis of formation of transmitter glutamate via an obligatory involvement of the malate-aspartate shuttle.",0,152 subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease; APOE4(-) subgroup,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"elevation of serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, up",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"cognition (ADAS-Cog), improved","Cognition, improved",AC-1202,MCT / Medium-chain fats,NS

Ketone bodies are produced by the body during glucose deprivation and are metabolized by the brain. An oral ketogenic compound, AC-1202, was tested in subjects with probable AD to examine if ketosis could improve cognitive performance. METHODS: Daily administration of AC-1202 was evaluated in 152 subjects diagnosed with mild to moderate AD in a US-based, 90-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects were on a normal diet and continued taking approved AD medications. Primary cognitive end points were mean change from Baseline in the AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and global scores in the AD Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). AC-1202 was compared to Placebo in several population groups, including: intention-to-treat (ITT), per protocol, and dosage compliant groups. Results were also stratified by APOE4 carriage status (a predefined analysis based on the epsilon 4 (E4) variant of the apolipoprotein E gene). This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, registry number NCT00142805, information available at http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00142805 RESULTS: AC-1202 significantly elevated a serum ketone body (beta-hydroxybutyrate) 2 hours after administration when compared to Placebo. In each of the population groups, a significant difference was found between AC-1202 and Placebo in mean change from Baseline in ADAS-Cog score on Day 45: 1.9 point difference, p = 0.0235 in ITT; 2.53 point difference, p = 0.0324 in per protocol; 2.6 point difference, p = 0.0215 in dosage compliant. Among participants who did not carry the APOE4 allele (E4(-)), a significant difference was found between AC-1202 and Placebo in mean change from Baseline in ADAS-Cog score on Day 45 and Day 90. In the ITT population, E4(-) participants (N = 55) administered AC-1202 had a significant 4.77 point difference in mean change from Baseline in ADAS-Cog scores at Day 45 (p = 0.0005) and a 3.36 point difference at Day 90 (p = 0.0148) compared to Placebo. In the per protocol population, E4(-) participants receiving AC-1202 (N = 37) differed from placebo by 5.73 points at Day 45 (p = 0.0027) and by 4.39 points at Day 90 (p = 0.0143). In the dosage compliant population, E4(-) participants receiving AC-1202 differed from placebo by 6.26 points at Day 45 (p = 0.0011, N = 38) and 5.33 points at Day 90 (p = 0.0063, N = 35). Furthermore, a significant pharmacologic response was observed between serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels and change in ADAS-Cog scores in E4(-) subjects at Day 90 (p = 0.008). Adverse events occurred more frequently in AC-1202 subjects, were primarily restricted to the gastrointestinal system, and were mainly mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature.

The present study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of DbetaHB against the cell death and apoptosis induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were pretreated with DbetaHB and followed by MPP+ exposure. The cell viability was determined by MTT assay. The morphological characteristics of apoptosis was observed by Acridine Orange (AO) staining and apoptotic rates were measured by flow cytometer. The product of lipid peroxidation, malondialdehyde (MDA), was measured using thiobarbituric acid method. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), intracellular ROS and total glutathione were detected by microplate reader. In PC12 cells, pretreatment with DbetaHB significantly reduced MPP+-induced the decrease of cell viability. AO staining and flow cytometric analysis found DbetaHB inhibited MPP+-induced apoptosis.

19950075,The Coupling of the Short-Circuit Current to Metabolism in the Urinary Bladder of the Toad.,"The relationship of the short-circuit current to metabolism was studied in the toad bladder in vitro. Substrates and inhibitors were added to the bathing medium and the effect on the short-circuit current was determined. The spontaneous decline in the short-circuit current that occurred in substrate-free media was prevented or reversed by the addition of glucose, pyruvate, lactate, or beta-hydroxybutyrate, whereas acetate and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates had no effect. A variety of metabolic inhibitors depressed the short-circuit current; depression by iodoacetate and by malonate was delayed by prior addition of pyruvate or lactate but not by glucose. The ability of a substrate to stimulate the current did not correlate with its rate of oxidation to CO(2). On the basis of earlier studies, the metabolic effects on the short-circuit current were assumed to reflect equivalent effects on the rate of active Na transport. It is suggested that the energy for Na transport is provided not by a general cellular metabolic pool but by a specific metabolic pathway or pathways spatially linked to the transport mechanism.",0,RL-34,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"ROS formation, down",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,NS,NS,RL-34 cells,Unspecified / Mixed,Cell line (origin unclear),mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
20163521,NADH-generating substrates reduce peroxyl radical toxicity in RL-34 cells.,"There is general agreement that oxidative stress may induce apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Recently it has been shown that NADH can be considered an important antioxidant as it reacts with peroxyl and alkoxyl radicals under in vitro conditions. Therefore, in the present study we hypothesized that an increase in intracellular NADH using specific substrates will protect RL-34 cells against cytotoxicity of 2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), which is a peroxyl radical generating compound. Cells treated for 24 hours with 6.0 mM AAPH were severely damaged: mitochondria were vacuolated, and the level of free radicals significantly increased. Both apoptotic and necrotic cells were detected (11.1% and 11.4%, respectively) even after 5 hours of treatment. Pretreatment of the cells with substrates which increase the intracellular level of NADH, such as lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and ethanol, distinctly inhibited AAPH-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and cell death. On the other hand, acetoacetate (AcA), which decrease the intracellular level of NADH, had opposite effects. Interestingly, NADH-generating substrates augment, while AcA reduced superoxide radical formation induced by AAPH. These results may suggest that although NADH generating substrates may exert some deleterious effects within a cell by inducing reductive stress, they diminish alkoxyl or peroxyl radical cytotoxicity. The protection is associated with a decrease in ROS formation measured by dichlorofluorescein, but with an increase in superoxide radical formation.",0,variety of epilepsy syndromes; different animal models; organotypic hippocampal slice cultures,human; animal; in vitro,NS; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"neuroprotection, up",Cell Death & Survival,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"neuronal damage, down; intrinsic and induced seizure-like activity, no-change; hippocampal network hyperexcitability, down","Neuronal survival, down; Seizure activity, no-change",D-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

Yet, a direct role for ketone bodies in limiting seizure and neuronal damage remains poorly understood. Using organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, we established an in vitro model of chronic ketosis for parallel studies of its neuroprotective and anti-convulsant effects. Chronic in vitro treatment with a ketone body, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, protected the cultures against chronic hypoglycemia, oxygen-glucose deprivation, and NMDA-induced excitotoxicity, but failed to suppress intrinsic and induced seizure-like activity, indicating improved neuroprotection is not directly translated into seizure control. However, chronic in vitro ketosis abolished hippocampal network hyperexcitability following a metabolic insult, hypoxia, demonstrating for the first time a direct link between metabolic resistance and better control of excessive, synchronous, abnormal electrical activity. These findings suggest that the KD and, possibly, exogenous ketone administration, can be more beneficial for the treatment of seizures associated with metabolic stress or underlying metabolic abnormalities, and can potentially be used to optimize clinical applications of the traditional KD or its variants.",0,Sprague-Dawley male rats; hemorrhagic shock (60% blood loss),animal,Animal – Rat; NS,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hemorrhagic shock,Injury & Trauma,"survival, increased","Survival, increased",systemic administration of d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (d-BHB) plus melatonin; infusion of 4 M d-BHB,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley male rats (320 +/- 23 g) underwent controlled loss of 60% blood volume. Rats were instrumented to measure mean arterial pressure, body temperature (Tb), and heart rate. A passive decrease in rat Tb in response to HS significantly increased survival over animals maintained at 37 degrees C (n = 5-6). Infusion of 4 M d-BHB, at a volume of only 5.5% of the total blood removed, significantly prolonged survival to a mean of 3 h compared with 90 min using equal osmolar 4 M NaCl (n = 6). In experiments where the shed blood was returned after 1 h of 60% blood loss, 4% fluid replacement with 4 M d-BHB plus 43 mM melatonin significantly prolonged survival up to 10 days after blood return compared with 4 M NaCl plus 43 mM melatonin and other control solutions (n = 10). We conclude that a slow decrease in animal Tb resulting from 60% blood loss, combined with infusion of 4 M d-BHB plus 43 mM melatonin, was beneficial for long-term survival after return of shed blood. This HS therapy is designed as a portable low-volume solution for further evaluation in a large-animal model and is ultimately intended for use in HS patients by first responders.",0,GK rat; INS-1 832/13 cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,pancreatic islets,Pancreas,INS-1 832/13 cells,Pancreatic Endocrine,β-cells (islet),mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"insulin release, up","Insulin secretion, up",NS,NS,NS

Less inhibition of insulin release was observed with two cell lines with less knockdown of SCOT.

Here we tested the hypothesis that ketone bodies directly inhibit insulin action in skeletal muscle. We investigated the effect of d,l-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOH; the major ketone body in vivo) on insulin-mediated glucose uptake (2-deoxyglucose) in isolated mouse soleus (oxidative) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL; glycolytic) muscle. BOH inhibited insulin-mediated glucose uptake in soleus (but not in EDL) muscle in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Following 19.5 h of exposure to 5 mM BOH, insulin-mediated (20 mU/ml) glucose uptake was inhibited by approximately 90% (substantial inhibition was also observed in 3-O-methylglucose transport). The inhibitory effect of BOH was reproduced with d- but not l-BOH. BOH did not significantly affect hypoxia- or AICAR-mediated (activates AMP-dependent protein kinase) glucose uptake. The BOH effect did not require the presence/utilization of glucose since it was also seen when glucose in the medium was substituted with pyruvate. To determine whether the BOH effect was mediated by oxidative stress, an exogenous antioxidant (1 mM tempol) was used; however, tempol did not reverse the BOH effect on insulin action. BOH did not alter the levels of total tissue GLUT4 protein or insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 but blocked insulin-mediated phosphorylation of protein kinase B by approximately 50%. These data demonstrate that BOH inhibits insulin-mediated glucose transport in oxidative muscle by inhibiting insulin signaling.

Type 1 diabetes is associated with elevated levels of blood PAI-1 and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence. However, type 1 diabetic patients have elevated blood levels of ketone bodies acetoacetate (AA) and 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). This study examined the hypothesis that hyperketonemia (ketosis) contributes to increased secretion of PAI-1 from the cells that form the vascular endothelium. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with different concentrations of AA or BHB in the presence or absence of high glucose (HG) and the amount of PAI-1 protein secreted by these cells into conditioned media was determined. Levels of PAI-1 secreted into conditioned media by these treated cells did not change significantly when compared to controls. High glucose induced a significant increase in PAI-1 secretion, but combination with AA or BHB did not cause significant effects on PAI-1 secretion caused by HG.

Additionally, the influence of ACA and BHB on kynurenic acid (KYNA) production was assessed in vitro in bovine retinal slices. METHODS: Female adult Brown-Norway rats in groups of 5-8 animals were used. ACA and BHB were administered intraperitoneally once a day for 21 consecutive days, and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was administered to control animals. After 2 weeks, the animals received intraocular NMDA (2 mul of a 10 mM solution in PBS) or intraocular PBS as a control. On day 19, retinal ganglion cells were labeled retrogradely with hydroxystilbamidine. Two days later, RGC density (cells per mm(2)) was assessed on retinal flatmounts. Additionaly, bovine retinal slices were incubated with NMDA and ACA or BHB at concentrations of 1.0 mM and 3.0 mM, and de novo KYNA production was measured using HPLC. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal ACA (250 mg/kg) or BHB (291.2 mg/kg) significantly protected RGC against NMDA-induced neurodegeneration. De novo KYNA production in bovine retinal slices was lowered by NMDA. Both ACA and BHB at a concentration of 3.0 mM significantly reduced the effects of NMDA. CONCLUSIONS: ACA and BHB had a significant dose-dependent neuroprotective effect on RGC in a rat model of NMDA-induced RGC damage. Both ketone bodies also significantly attenuated NMDA-induced reduction of retinal KYNA production in vitro, suggesting that this mechanism may be essential for the neuroprotective effects of ACA and BHB in vivo.

20838951,The role of pharmacokinetics in determining the response of rodent embryos to teratogens in whole-embryo culture.,"The rodent embryo's response to teratogenic insult in whole-embryo culture during the period of neurulation was characterized by determining the role of pharmacokinetics and embryonic recovery in producing abnormal growth and development. Five known teratogens, hydroxyurea, cyclophosphamide, cadmium, diphenylhydantoin, and the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate were employed. The dose and exposure times in vitro were designed to reproduce the peak serum concentrations and half-life of the compounds present following the administration of a teratogenic or maximum maternally tolerated dose of the agents in vivo. The results showed: first, that both the serum concentration and duration of exposure to an agent play a role in determining the embryonic response in vitro; secondly, that compounds that do not produce effects during the period of neurulation or that require maternal metabolic activation are not teratogenic in culture; and thirdly, that embryos have the capacity to recover from certain teratogenic insults in vitro. Thus, both pharmacokinetics and the potential for embryonic recovery should be considered when applying the whole-embryo culture technique to studies in teratology and toxicology.",0; KYAT1; AADAT,brain cortical slices; primary glial cultures; cortical homogenate; cultured glial cells,in vitro,Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice; In vitro – Primary cells,"protein kinase A-dependent stimulation of KATs, up",Epigenetic Regulation,brain cortex,Brain/CNS,glial cells,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"excitatory glutamate-mediated neurotransmission, down","Neurotransmission, down",ketogenic diet or non-treated diabetes mellitus,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
20851857,Novel aspect of ketone action: beta-hydroxybutyrate increases brain synthesis of kynurenic acid in vitro.,"Ketone bodies formed during ketogenic diet or non-treated diabetes mellitus may exert neuroprotective and antiepileptic effects. Here, we assessed the influence of ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on the brain synthesis of kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous antagonist of glutamatergic and alpha7-nicotinic receptors. In brain cortical slices and in primary glial cultures, BHB enhanced KYNA production. KT 5270, an inhibitor of protein kinase A, has prevented this action. At hypoglycemia, under pH 7.0 and 7.4, profound (15 mM BHB), but not mild (3 mM) ketosis increased synthesis of KYNA. In paradigm resembling diabetic ketoacidosis in vitro (30 mM glucose, pH 7.0), neither mild nor profound ketosis influenced the production of KYNA. At pH 7.4 and in 30 mM glucose though, both mild and severe ketonemia evoked an increase of KYNA production. The activity of KYNA biosynthetic enzymes, KAT I and KAT II, in cortical homogenate was not altered by BHB (0.05-10.0 mM). However, in cultured glial cells exposed to BHB (10 mM), the activity of KATs increased. This effect was reversed by the co-incubation of cells with KT 5270. Presented data reveal a novel mechanism of action of BHB. Increased synthesis of KYNA in the presence of BHB is most probably mediated by protein kinase A-dependent stimulation of KATs expression/activity leading to an increase of KYNA formation. Ensuing attenuation of the excessive excitatory glutamate-mediated neurotransmission may, at least in part, explain the neuroprotective actions of BHB.",0,timed-mated pregnant mice; fetal lung explant cultures,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"ketone body metabolism, up",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"branching morphogenesis, no-change","Branching morphogenesis, no-change",Exogenous BOHB; circulating plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

In order to determine the nature of any gross alterations in fetal growth during early organogenesis, we supplied timed-mated pregnant mice with diets containing 6% protein (6%P), 9% protein (9%P) or 18% protein (18%P; control) from day 0 of pregnancy. At embryonic days 11 (E11), 12 (E12) and 13 (E13), females were killed and fetuses removed. Gross morphological analysis revealed that fetal limb growth was impaired between E11 and E12 in 6%P animals, but this recovered by E13. Likewise, fetal liver growth and lung branching morphogenesis were seen to exhibit an initial growth impairment at E12 followed by a rapid recovery by E13. Coincident with the observed changes in fetal growth, we noted an elevation in maternal hepatic triglyceride content, expression of the ketogenic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (Hmgcs2) and circulating plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB). In addition, fetal liver Hmgcs2 expression was switched on by E13 in both 6%P- and 9%P-exposed animals. Exogenous BOHB did not influence branching morphogenesis in fetal lung explant cultures; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that this may occur in vivo. In conclusion, we find that disturbance of fetal growth by maternal dietary protein restriction is associated and therefore potentially indicated by changes in maternal and fetal ketone body metabolism.",HMGCS2; TGFB1; 0; VIM; CDH1,type 2 diabetic db/db mice; RPTC cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"enhanced ketone body production, up",Metabolic Regulation,kidney,Kidney,RPTC cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Multi-disease,"epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, up","Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, up",1 mM beta-HB,In vitro media supplementation,NS

To date, the molecular mechanisms of DN remain largely unclear. The present study aimed to identify and characterize novel proteins involved in the development of DN by a proteomic approach. Proteomic analysis revealed that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase 2 (HMGCS2), the key enzyme in ketogenesis, was increased fourfold in the kidneys of type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Consistently, the activity of HMGCS2 in kidneys and 24-h urinary excretion of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) were significantly increased in db/db mice. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and real-time PCR studies further demonstrated that HMGCS2 was highly expressed in renal glomeruli of db/db mice, with weak expression in the kidneys of control mice. Because filtered ketone bodies are mainly reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, we used RPTC cells, a rat proximal tubule cell line, to examine the effect of the increased level of ketone bodies. Treating cultured RPTC cells with 1 mM beta-HB significantly induced transforming growth factor-beta1 expression, with a marked increase in collagen I expression. beta-HB treatment also resulted in a marked increase in vimentin protein expression and a significant reduction in E-cadherin protein levels, suggesting an enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in RPTCs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that diabetic kidneys exhibit excess ketogenic activity resulting from increased HMGCS2 expression. Enhanced ketone body production in the diabetic kidney may represent a novel mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of DN.",0,neonatal hippocampal slices,in vitro,Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"modulation of neuronal energy homeostasis, NS",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,neonatal hippocampus,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",complementary energy substrate (CES); added exogenously,NS; Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
21106838,Inhibition of spontaneous network activity in neonatal hippocampal slices by energy substrates is not correlated with intracellular acidification.,"Several energy substrates complementary to glucose, including lactate, pyruvate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, serve as a fuel for neurons. It was reported recently that these substrates can substantially modulate cortical excitability in neonatal slices. However, complementary energy substrates (CES) can also induce an intracellular acidification when added exogenously. Therefore, action of CES on the neuronal properties governing excitability in neonatal brain slices may be underlain by a change in the cell energy status or by intracellular acidification, or both. Here, we attempt to elucidate these possibilities in neonatal hippocampus by recording neuronal population activity and monitoring intracellular pH. We show that a spontaneous network activity pattern, giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs), characteristic for the neonatal hippocampal slices exposed to artificial cerebrospinal fluid, is strongly inhibited by CES and this effect is unlikely to be caused by a subtle intracellular acidification induced by these compounds. Indeed, a much stronger intracellular acidification in the HCO(3) -free solution inhibited neither the GDP frequency nor the GDP amplitude. Therefore, modulation of neuronal energy homeostasis is the most likely factor underlying the effect of lactate, pyruvate and beta-hydroxybutyrate on network excitability in neonatal brain slices.",0,neonatal mouse brain slices,animal; in vitro,Multi-model,"GABA-mediated depolarization, no-change",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,upper cortical plate,Brain/CNS,immature cells of the upper cortical plate,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

Recently published data, however, point to the possibility that the presumed depolarizing mode of GABA action during early development might represent an artifact due to an insufficient energy supply of the in vitro preparations used. Specifically, addition of the ketone body dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) to the extracellular medium was shown to prevent GABA from exerting excitatory effects. Applying a complementary set of minimally invasive optical and electrophysiological techniques in brain slices from neonatal mice, we investigated the effects of betaHB on GABA actions in immature cells of the upper cortical plate. Fluorescence imaging revealed that GABA-mediated somatic [Ca(2+)] transients, that required activation of GABA(A) receptors and voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, remained unaffected by betaHB. Cell-attached current-clamp recordings showed that, in the presence of betaHB, GABA still induced a membrane potential depolarization. To estimate membrane potential changes quantitatively, we used cell-attached recordings of voltage-gated potassium currents and demonstrated that the GABA-mediated depolarization was independent of supplementation of the extracellular solution with betaHB. We conclude that, in vitro, GABA depolarizes immature cells of the upper cortical plate in the presence of the ketone body betaHB. Our data thereby support the general concept of an excitatory-to-inhibitory switch of GABA action during early development.",0,U937 monocyte cell culture,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"mitochondrial membrane potential, no-change",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,NS,NS,U937 monocyte,Hematopoietic / Immune,Monocytes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Hyperketonemia is increasingly being identified in type 2 diabetic patients in addition to those with type 1 diabetes. No previous study has examined the effect of hyperketonemia and trivalent chromium on cellular mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in any cell type. Using a U937 monocyte cell culture model, this study examined the hypothesis that hyperketonemia decreases and trivalent chromium normalizes the cellular MMP level. Cells were cultured with control and ketone bodies [acetoacetate (AA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)] in the absence or the presence (0.5-100 muM) of Cr(3+) at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The MMP was determined using DiOC6 and flow cytometry. The results show a significant decrease in MMP in cells treated with AA, but not in the cells treated with BHB. The effect of AA on cellular MMP was prevented in chromium (III)-pretreated cells. Thus, hyperketonemia decreases the MMP, and supplementation with chromium (III) normalizes altered MMP, which may play a role in the improvement in glucose metabolism seen after chromium (III) supplementation in some studies with diabetic animals and patients.",0; SLC12A5,rat pups (postnatal days 4-7),animal,Animal – Rat,"GABA signaling, no-change",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,developing brain,Brain/CNS,immature neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",DL-3-hydroxybutyrate (DL-BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic
21321316,Depolarizing actions of GABA in immature neurons depend neither on ketone bodies nor on pyruvate.,"GABA depolarizes immature neurons because of a high [Cl(-)](i) and orchestrates giant depolarizing potential (GDP) generation. Zilberter and coworkers (Rheims et al., 2009; Holmgren et al., 2010) showed recently that the ketone body metabolite DL-3-hydroxybutyrate (DL-BHB) (4 mM), lactate (4 mM), or pyruvate (5 mM) shifted GABA actions to hyperpolarizing, suggesting that the depolarizing effects of GABA are attributable to inadequate energy supply when glucose is the sole energy source. We now report that, in rat pups (postnatal days 4-7), plasma D-BHB, lactate, and pyruvate levels are 0.9, 1.5, and 0.12 mM, respectively. Then, we show that DL-BHB (4 mM) and pyruvate (200 muM) do not affect (i) the driving force for GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents (DF(GABA)) in cell-attached single-channel recordings, (2) the resting membrane potential and reversal potential of synaptic GABA(A) receptor-mediated responses in perforated patch recordings, (3) the action potentials triggered by focal GABA applications, or (4) the GDPs determined with electrophysiological recordings and dynamic two-photon calcium imaging. Only very high nonphysiological concentrations of pyruvate (5 mM) reduced DF(GABA) and blocked GDPs. Therefore, DL-BHB does not alter GABA signals even at the high concentrations used by Zilberter and colleagues, whereas pyruvate requires exceedingly high nonphysiological concentrations to exert an effect.

21454710,A ketogenic diet impairs energy and glucose homeostasis by the attenuation of hypothalamic leptin signaling and hepatic insulin signaling in a rat model of non-obese type 2 diabetes.,"Ketogenic diets (KTD) are reported to have beneficial effects on the regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis, but remain controversial. We investigated the effects of KTD and ketones on insulin resistance and secretion in non-obese type 2 diabetic rats and their mechanism. KTD (82% energy as fat), intraperitoneal injection of beta-hydroxybutyrate (IHB; 150 mg/kg bw/12 h) with a control diet (COD; 20% energy as fat) or saline injection with COD was given to 90% pancreatectomized (Px) diabetic rats for five weeks. KTD increased epididymal fat pads and serum leptin levels without increasing energy intake, but IHB decreased them. KTD, but not IHB, attenuated hypothalamic signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in KTD. Serum glucagon levels were markedly higher in the KTD group than in other groups. During an oral glucose tolerance test, serum glucose levels slowly increased until 80 min in the KTD group and then decreased very slowly. Insulin secretion capacity during a hyperglycemic clamp was significantly lower in the IHB group than in other groups. However, a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp revealed that KTD decreased glucose infusion rates and increased hepatic glucose output in hyperinsulinemic states while IHB had opposite effects to KTD. The increased hepatic glucose output in KTD was associated with increased hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression through attenuated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 and phosphorylation of Akt(Ser473). Hepatic AMPK(Thr172) phosphorylation was reduced in KTD. In conclusion, KTD impairs energy and glucose homeostasis by exacerbating insulin resistance and attenuating hypothalamic leptin signaling in non-obese type 2 diabetic rats. These changes are not associated with increased serum ketone levels.",INS,human pancreatic islets; rat islets; mouse islets; INS-1 832/13 cell line,human; animal; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells; Animal – Rat; Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,human pancreatic islets,Pancreas,beta cells,Pancreatic Endocrine,β-cells (islet),mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"insulin secretion, up","Insulin secretion, up",NS,NS,NS

However, human islets may be different. We observed that the enzyme activity, protein level, and relative mRNA level of the key anaplerotic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC) were 80-90% lower in human pancreatic islets compared with islets of rats and mice and the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1 832/13. Activity and protein of ATP citrate lyase, which uses anaplerotic products in the cytosol, were 60-75% lower in human islets than in rodent islets or the cell line. In line with the lower PC, the percentage of glucose-derived pyruvate that entered mitochondrial metabolism via carboxylation in human islets was only 20-30% that in rat islets. This suggests human islets depend less on pyruvate carboxylation than rodent models that were used to establish the role of PC in insulin secretion. Human islets possessed high levels of succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase, an enzyme that forms acetoacetate in the mitochondria, and acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase, which uses acetoacetate to form acyl-CoAs in the cytosol. Glucose-stimulated human islets released insulin similarly to rat islets but formed much more acetoacetate. beta-Hydroxybutyrate augmented insulin secretion in human islets. This information supports previous data that indicate beta cells can use a pathway involving succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase and acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase to synthesize and use acetoacetate and suggests human islets may use this pathway more than PC and citrate to form cytosolic acyl-CoAs.",0,suckling rat pups (postnatal days 5-9),animal,Animal – Rat,"neuronal excitability, down",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,somatosensory barrel cortex,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"flurothyl-induced electrographic seizures, no-change; seizure build-up during repetitive flurothyl, down","Seizure activity, no-change; Seizure activity, down",exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

However, little is known on the impact of physiological ketosis on brain excitability. We addressed this question in suckling rats in vivo. 16-channel extracellular field potential recordings were performed from somatosensory barrel cortex at postnatal days 5-9 non-anaesthetized rat pups. Seizures were induced by the volatile convulsant agent flurothyl. One hour after blockade of physiological ketogenesis using combined administration of beta-oxidation inhibitors mercaptoacetate, insulin and glucose to prevent hypoglycemia, we found no significant change in the flurothyl-induced electrographic seizures. However, build-up of seizures during two repetitive flurothyl applications was strongly aggravated in the animals with blocked ketogenesis. The effect of ketogenesis inhibitors was reversed by exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate. Diazepam exerted anticonvulsive action both under physiological ketosis and after blockade of ketogenesis, and bumetanide had no significant anticonvulsive effects in both conditions. Thus, physiological ketosis reduces excitability in the immature brain and elimination of physiological ketosis results in elimination of this anticonvulsant effect. Our study raises concern that the changes in diet, and pharmacological manipulations such as glucose infusion, and pathologies such as hyperinsulinism which break natural ketosis, may be a potential risk factor for epileptogenesis in nursing infants.",FFAR3,mouse; human,animal; human,Animal – Mouse; NS,"GPR41 antagonism, down",Ion & Nutrient Transport,sympathetic ganglion,Peripheral nerves & ganglia (PNS),sympathetic neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"energy expenditure, down","Energy expenditure, down",produced during starvation or diabetes,Fasting / Caloric restriction (endogenous),NS
21530659,Short-chain fatty acids and ketones directly regulate sympathetic nervous system via G protein-coupled receptor 41 (GPR41).,"The maintenance of energy homeostasis is essential for life, and its dysregulation leads to a variety of metabolic disorders. Under a fed condition, mammals use glucose as the main metabolic fuel, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the colonic bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber also contribute a significant proportion of daily energy requirement. Under ketogenic conditions such as starvation and diabetes, ketone bodies produced in the liver from fatty acids are used as the main energy sources. To balance energy intake, dietary excess and starvation trigger an increase or a decrease in energy expenditure, respectively, by regulating the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The regulation of metabolic homeostasis by glucose is well recognized; however, the roles of SCFAs and ketone bodies in maintaining energy balance remain unclear. Here, we show that SCFAs and ketone bodies directly regulate SNS activity via GPR41, a Gi/o protein-coupled receptor for SCFAs, at the level of the sympathetic ganglion. GPR41 was most abundantly expressed in sympathetic ganglia in mouse and humans. SCFA propionate promoted sympathetic outflow via GPR41. On the other hand, a ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate, produced during starvation or diabetes, suppressed SNS activity by antagonizing GPR41. Pharmacological and siRNA experiments indicated that GPR41-mediated activation of sympathetic neurons involves Gbetagamma-PLCbeta-MAPK signaling. Sympathetic regulation by SCFAs and ketone bodies correlated well with their respective effects on energy consumption. These findings establish that SCFAs and ketone bodies directly regulate GPR41-mediated SNS activity and thereby control body energy expenditure in maintaining metabolic homeostasis.",MDH1,G93ASOD1 cell line; wild-type SOD1 cell line,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"alternative energy substrate, up",Metabolic Regulation,motor neuron,Brain/CNS,motor neuron,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,Neurodegenerative,"NS, nan","NS, nan",d-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB
21540444,Glutamate and glutathione interplay in a motor neuronal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis reveals altered energy metabolism.,"Impairment of mitochondrial function might contribute to oxidative stress associated with neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Glutamate levels in tissues of ALS patients are sometimes altered. In neurons, mitochondrial metabolism of exogenous glutamine is mainly responsible for the net synthesis of glutamate, which is a neurotransmitter, but it is also necessary for the synthesis of glutathione, the main endogenous antioxidant. We investigated glutathione synthesis and glutamine/glutamate metabolism in a motor neuronal model of familial ALS. In standard culture conditions (with glutamine) or restricting glutamine or cystine, the level of glutathione was always lower in the cell line expressing the mutant (G93A) human Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (G93ASOD1) than in the line expressing wild-type SOD1. With glutamine the difference in glutathione was associated with a lower glutamate and impairment of the glutamine/glutamate metabolism as evidenced by lower glutaminase and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase activity. d-beta-hydroxybutyrate, as an alternative to glutamine as energy substrate in addition to glucose, reversed the decreases of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase activity and glutamate and glutathione. However, in the G93ASOD1 cell line, in all culture conditions the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase l protein, which down-regulates pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, was induced, together with an increase in lactate release in the medium. These findings suggest that the glutathione decrease associated with mutant SOD1 expression is due to mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the reduction of the flow of glucose-derived pyruvate through the TCA cycle; it implies altered glutamate metabolism and depends on the different mitochondrial energy substrates.",ITGAL,U937; THP-1; HUVECs; isolated human monocytes,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line; In vitro – Primary cells,"LFA-1 affinity, up",Inflammation & Immune Response,endothelium,Vasculature,monocytes,Hematopoietic / Immune,Monocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Multi-disease,"monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion, up","Cell adhesion, up",beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) (0-10 mM),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

The objective of this study was to examine the hypothesis that hyperketonemia increases monocyte-endothelial cell (EC) adhesion and the development of vascular disease in diabetes. Human U937 and THP-1 monocyte cell lines and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured with acetoacetate (AA) (0-10 mM) or beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) (0-10 mM) for 24 h prior to evaluating adhesion and adhesion molecule expression. The results demonstrate a significant (P < 0.01) increase in both U937 and THP-1 adhesion to HUVEC monolayers treated with 4 mM AA compared with control. Equal concentrations of BHB resulted in similar increases in monocyte-EC adhesion. Similarly, treatments of AA or BHB to isolated monocytes from human blood also show increases in adhesion to endothelial cells. intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was significantly increased on the surface of HUVECs and an increase in total protein expression with AA treatment compared with control. The expression level of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) was increased in monocytes treated with AA, and LFA-1 affinity was altered from low to high affinity following treatment with both AA and BHB. Monocyte adhesion could be blocked when cells were preincubated with an antibody to ICAM-1 or LFA-1. Results also show a significant increase in IL-8 and MCP-1 secretion in monocytes and HUVECs treated with 0-10 mM AA. These results suggest that hyperketonemia can induce monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and that it is mediated via increased ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells and increased expression and affinity of LFA-1 in monocytes.",0,PND35 rats; PND70 rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"ketone metabolism, up",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Traumatic brain injury,Injury & Trauma,"neurochemical and cerebral metabolic recovery, up","Neurochemical recovery, up",ketogenic diet,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
21652033,Ketogenic diet prevents alterations in brain metabolism in young but not adult rats after traumatic brain injury.,"Previous studies have shown that the change of cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) in response to traumatic brain injury (TBI) is different in young (PND35) and adult rats (PND70), and that prolonged ketogenic diet treatment results in histological and behavioral neuroprotection only in younger rat brains. However, the mechanism(s) through which ketones act in the injured brain and the biochemical markers of their action remain unknown. Therefore, the current study was initiated to: 1) determine the effect of injury on the neurochemical profile in PND35 compared to PND70 rats; and 2) test the effect of early post-injury administration of ketogenic diet on brain metabolism in PND35 versus PND70 rats. The data show that alterations in energy metabolites, amino acid, and membrane metabolites were not evident in PND35 rats on standard diet until 24 h after injury, when the concentration of most metabolites was reduced from sham-injured values. In contrast, acute, but transient deficits in energy metabolism were measured at 6 h in PND70 rats, together with deficits in N-acetylaspartate that endured until 24 h. Administration of a ketogenic diet resulted in significant increases in plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) levels. Similarly, brain betaOHB levels were significantly elevated in all injured rats, but were elevated by 43% more in PND35 rats compared to PND70 rats. As a result, ATP, creatine, and phosphocreatine levels at 24 h after injury were significantly improved in the ketogenic PND35 rats, but not in the PND70 group. The improvement in energy metabolism in the PND35 brains was accompanied by the recovery of NAA and reduction of lactate levels, as well as amelioration of the deficits of other amino acids and membrane metabolites. These results indicate that the PND35 brains are more resistant to the injury, indicated by a delayed deficit in energy metabolism. Moreover, the younger brains revert to ketones metabolism more quickly than do the adult brains, resulting in better neurochemical and cerebral metabolic recovery after injury.",IRS2; AKT1; PCK1; 0,90% pancreatectomized (Px) diabetic rats fed a high fat diet; non-diabetic Sham rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"potentiation of hypothalamic leptin and insulin signaling, up",Multiple mechanisms,hypothalamus,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"glucose homeostasis, improved","Glycemic control, improved",intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion,NS,NS

Ketones may work through the brain; therefore, we evaluated whether the intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrates would also modulate peripheral energy and glucose homeostasis, and through what mechanisms, in diabetic rats fed a high fat diet in short- and long-term studies. Short-term (3h) central injection of BHB (50 mug/h) improved serum glucose levels and peripheral insulin sensitivity compared to the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) group among 90% pancreatectomized (Px) diabetic rats, but not in non-diabetic Sham rats. In addition to short-term infusion, long-term (28 days) central infusion of BHB (12 mug/h) elevated serum BHB levels. Long-term infusion of BHB potentiated leptin and insulin signaling in the hypothalamus to slightly decrease body weight in Px rats. Central BHB infusion had a greater effect on peripheral glucose metabolism than overall energy metabolism. Hepatic insulin signaling (tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2-->serine phosphorylation of Akt-->reduced expression of PEPCK) was potentiated and hepatic glucose production in the hyperinsulinemic state was suppressed in the diabetic rats. In addition, glucose tolerance was improved by central BHB infusion through enhanced whole body glucose disposal rates, but insulin secretion was not affected in the diabetic rats. In conclusion, mild ketosis by central infusion of ketones improves energy and glucose metabolism through the potentiation of leptin and insulin signaling in the hypothalamus of diabetic rats.",0,mouse; Kir6.2 knock-out mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"activity-dependent opening, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,dentate gyrus,Brain/CNS,granule cells,Neural / Glial,Neurons,submembrane,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"epileptic seizures, down","Seizure activity, down",R-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
21723679,Single K ATP channel opening in response to action potential firing in mouse dentate granule neurons.,"ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP) channels) are important sensors of cellular metabolic state that link metabolism and excitability in neuroendocrine cells, but their role in nonglucosensing central neurons is less well understood. To examine a possible role for K(ATP) channels in modulating excitability in hippocampal circuits, we recorded the activity of single K(ATP) channels in cell-attached patches of granule cells in the mouse dentate gyrus during bursts of action potentials generated by antidromic stimulation of the mossy fibers. Ensemble averages of the open probability (p(open)) of single K(ATP) channels over repeated trials of stimulated spike activity showed a transient increase in p(open) in response to action potential firing. Channel currents were identified as K(ATP) channels through blockade with glibenclamide and by comparison with recordings from Kir6.2 knock-out mice. The transient elevation in K(ATP) p(open) may arise from submembrane ATP depletion by the Na(+)-K(+) ATPase, as the pump blocker strophanthidin reduced the magnitude of the elevation. Both the steady-state and stimulus-elevated p(open) of the recorded channels were higher in the presence of the ketone body R-beta-hydroxybutyrate, consistent with earlier findings that ketone bodies can affect K(ATP) activity. Using perforated-patch recording, we also found that K(ATP) channels contribute to the slow afterhyperpolarization following an evoked burst of action potentials. We propose that activity-dependent opening of K(ATP) channels may help granule cells act as a seizure gate in the hippocampus and that ketone-body-mediated augmentation of the activity-dependent opening could in part explain the effect of the ketogenic diet in reducing epileptic seizures.",0,ICR mice; postnatal day 21; male,animal,Animal – Mouse; NS,"anticonvulsant, positive",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"latency to seizure onset, up; seizure behavior grade (severity), no-change","Seizure activity, up; Seizure severity, no-change",intraperitoneal injection (20 mmol/kg),Intraperitoneal BHB,NS

Eighty-five male, postnatal day 21, ICR mice were used. All mice were pretreated with scopolamine methylbromide (1 mg/kg) 30 min prior to pilocarpine administration. Experimental mice (n=46) were injected intraperitoneally with BHB (20 mmol/kg), 15 min prior to pilocarpine administration; control animals (n=39) were administered normal saline. Pilocarpine (300 mg/kg) was then administered intraperitoneally to induce seizures. Mice were monitored for 2 h after pilocarpine injection, and seizure behavior grades were evaluated according to Racine's scale. All mice developed typical seizure behaviors of grade 3 or higher. Although the severity in terms of seizure behavior grade was not significantly different between groups, the mean (+/-SD) latency to the onset of seizure was significantly prolonged in BHB-treated mice (5.15+/-2.19 min) compared with controls (2.95+/-1.06 min; p<0.001). This study demonstrates that treatment with BHB significantly prolongs the latency to the onset of seizures induced by pilocarpine in mice and suggests that BHB, one of the ketone bodies, may be direct anticonvulsant.",0,halothane-anesthetized rats fasted for 36 hours (n=6),animal,Animal – Rat,"ketone body oxidation, up",Metabolic Regulation,cerebral cortex,Brain/CNS,neurons; astrocytes,Neural / Glial,Neurons; Astrocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan","intravenous [2,4-(13)C(2)]-D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

Time courses of (13)C-enriched brain amino acids (glutamate-C4, glutamine-C4, and glutamate and glutamine-C3) were measured at 9.4 Tesla using spatially localized (1)H-[(13)C]-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Metabolic rates were estimated by fitting a constrained, two-compartment (neuron-astrocyte) metabolic model to the (13)C time-course data. We found that ketone body oxidation was substantial, accounting for 40% of total substrate oxidation (glucose plus ketone bodies) by neurons and astrocytes. D-beta-Hydroxybutyrate was oxidized to a greater extent in neurons than in astrocytes ( approximately 70:30), and followed a pattern closely similar to the metabolism of [1-(13)C]glucose reported in previous studies. Total neuronal tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) flux in hyperketonemic rats was similar to values reported for normal (nonketotic) anesthetized rats infused with [1-(13)C]glucose, but neuronal glucose oxidation was 40% to 50% lower, indicating that ketone bodies had compensated for the reduction in glucose use.",0,brain mitochondria,in vitro,NS,"removal of acetoacetate action, up",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
21767449,The control of mitochondrial succinate-dependent H2O2 production.,"In brain mitochondria succinate activates H(2)O(2) release, concentration dependently (starting at 15 muM), and in the presence of NAD dependent substrates (glutamate, pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate). We report that TCA cycle metabolites (citrate, isocitrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, fumarate, malate) individually and quickly inhibit H(2)O(2) release. When they are present together at physiological concentration (0.2, 0.01, 0.15, 0.12, 0.2 mM respectively) they decrease H(2)O(2) production by over 60% at 0.1-0.2 mM succinate. The degree of inhibition depends on the concentration of each metabolite. Acetoacetate is a strong inhibitor of H(2)O(2) release, starting at 10 muM and acting quickly. It potentiates the inhibition induced by TCA cycle metabolites. The action of acetoacetate is partially removed by beta-hydroxybutyrate. Removal is minimal at 0.1 mM acetoacetate, and is higher at 0.5 mM acetoacetate. We conclude that several inhibitors of H(2)O(2) release act jointly and concentration dependently to rapidly set the required level of H(2)O(2) generation at each succinate concentration.",0,healthy subjects (n=22),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"concentration, up",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"appetite, down","Appetite, down",NS,NS,NS

A total of twenty-two healthy subjects (ten men and twelve women: age 23 (sem 1) years, BMI 22.1 (sem 0.5) kg/m(2)) received an isoenergetic high-protein (30/0/70 % of energy from protein/carbohydrate/fat) or normal-protein diet (12/55/33 % of energy from protein/carbohydrate/fat) for 1.5 d in a randomised cross-over design. Appetite ratings were measured using visual analogue scales (VAS); endogenous glucose production and GNG were measured via infusion of [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose and ingestion of (2)H(2)O. Moreover, fasting glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were measured. Glycogen stores were lowered at the start with a glycogen-lowering exercise test. During the high-protein compared with the normal-protein diet, GNG was increased and appetite was suppressed (GNG: 148 (sem 7) v. 133 (sem 6) g/24 h, P < 0.05; and 24 h area under the curve for hunger: 694 (sem 46) v. 1055 (sem 52) mm VAS x 24 h, P < 0.001; fullness: 806 (sem 59) v. 668 (sem 64) mm VAS x 24 h, P < 0.05; desire to eat: 762 (sem 48) v. 1004 (sem 66) mm VAS x 24 h, P < 0.001).

Cord blood erythropoietin levels were similar in both groups. There was a positive strong correlation between maternal beta-OHB levels and polycythaemia in newborn infants, indicating that beta-OHB could activate erythropoiesis independently from intrauterine hyperinsulinaemia and/or erythropoietin levels, and may be important in the pathogenesis of polycythaemia in infants born to diabetic mothers.",0,porcine,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,serum,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hemorrhagic shock,Injury & Trauma,"24-h survival, up; base deficit, down; oxygen consumption, up; resuscitative fluid volume, down (trend)","Survival, up; Acid-base balance, down; VO2max, up; Resuscitative fluid volume, down (trend)",4M BHB and 43 mM melatonin (BHB/M),In vitro media supplementation,NS
21886776,Treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate and melatonin is associated with improved survival in a porcine model of hemorrhagic shock.,"INTRODUCTION: The neuroprotective ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and the antioxidant melatonin have been found at elevated levels in hibernating mammals. Previous studies in rat models of hemorrhagic shock have suggested a benefit. We compared infusion of 4M BHB and 43 mM melatonin (BHB/M) to 4M sodium chloride and 20% DMSO (control solution) to evaluate for potential benefits in porcine hemorrhagic shock. METHODS: Hemorrhagic shock was induced to obtain systolic blood pressures <50 mmHg for 60 min. Pigs were treated with a bolus of either BHB/M (n=9) or control solution (n=8) followed by 4-h infusion of the either BHB/M or control solution. All animals were then resuscitated for 20 h after shock. Physiological data were continually recorded, and blood samples were taken at intervals throughout the experiment. Serum samples were analyzed via high resolution NMR for metabolomic response. RESULTS: BHB/M treatment significantly increased 24-h survival time when compared to treatment with control solution (100% versus 62%; p=0.050), with a trend toward decreased volume of resuscitative fluid administered to animals receiving BHB/M. BHB/M-treated animals had lower base deficit and higher oxygen consumption when compared to animals receiving control solution. Serum metabolite profiles revealed increases in beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), succinate, 2-oxovalerate and adipate with BHB/M treatment as compared with animals treated with control infusion. CONCLUSION: Infusion of BHB/M conferred a survival benefit over infusion of control solution in hemorrhagic shock. BHB and its products of metabolism are identified in serum of animals subjected to shock and treated with BHB/M.

21931779,The depolarizing action of GABA in cultured hippocampal neurons is not due to the absence of ketone bodies.,"Two recent reports propose that the depolarizing action of GABA in the immature brain is an artifact of in vitro preparations in which glucose is the only energy source. The authors argue that this does not mimic the physiological environment because the suckling rats use ketone bodies and pyruvate as major sources of metabolic energy. Here, we show that availability of physiologically relevant levels of ketone bodies has no impact on the excitatory action of GABA in immature cultured hippocampal neurons. Addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the primary ketone body in the neonate rat, affected neither intracellular calcium elevation nor membrane depolarizations induced by the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol, when assessed with calcium imaging or perforated patch-clamp recording, respectively. These results confirm that the addition of ketone bodies to the extracellular environment to mimic conditions in the neonatal brain does not reverse the chloride gradient and therefore render GABA hyperpolarizing. Our data are consistent with the existence of a genuine ""developmental switch"" mechanism in which GABA goes from having a predominantly excitatory role in immature cells to a predominantly inhibitory one in adults.",0,3-NP treated mice; R6/2 transgenic mice; PC12 cells with inducible mutant huntingtin,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"histone deacetylation, down",Epigenetic Regulation,striatum,Brain/CNS,PC12 cells,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Huntington's disease,Neurodegenerative,"motor deficits, down; striatal lesions, down; microgliosis, down; life span, up","Motor function, down; Brain injury, down; Neuroinflammation, down; Lifespan, up",D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DbetaHB) infusion,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

Given the lack of effective therapies for HD, we sought to assess the neuroprotective properties of the mitochondrial energizing ketone body, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DbetaHB), in the 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) toxic and the R6/2 genetic model of HD. In mice treated with 3-NP, a complex II inhibitor, infusion of DbetaHB attenuates motor deficits, striatal lesions, and microgliosis in this model of toxin induced-striatal neurodegeneration. In transgenic R6/2 mice, infusion of DbetaHB extends life span, attenuates motor deficits, and prevents striatal histone deacetylation. In PC12 cells with inducible expression of mutant huntingtin protein, we further demonstrate that DbetaHB prevents histone deacetylation via a mechanism independent of its mitochondrial effects and independent of histone deacetylase inhibition. These pre-clinical findings suggest that by simultaneously targeting the mitochondrial and the epigenetic abnormalities associated with mutant huntingtin, DbetaHB may be a valuable therapeutic agent for HD.",AKT1,isolated mouse soleus muscle,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse,"Akt phosphorylation, down",Metabolic Regulation,soleus muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"insulin-mediated glucose uptake, down","Insulin sensitivity, down",5mM BOH,In vitro media supplementation,NS
22232599,AICAR reverses ketone body mediated insulin resistance in isolated oxidative muscle.,"Recently it was demonstrated that the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOH) inhibits insulin-mediated glucose transport in isolated oxidative muscle, which was associated with decreased phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B. The purpose of the present study was to determine if activation of AMP-dependent protein kinase by the pharmacological activator AICAR could reverse the insulin resistance induced by BOH. Isolated mouse soleus muscle was incubated in vitro in the absence or presence of 5mM BOH for approximately 20 h. Following prolonged incubation, insulin increased 2-deoxyglucose glucose (2-DG) uptake 3-fold, but in the presence of BOH most of the insulin response was lost (only approximately 30% remained). Addition of 2mM AICAR during the last 2h of prolonged incubation increased the insulin response in the presence of BOH to approximately 80% of the normal insulin effect on 2-DG uptake. The AICAR-mediated reversal of the insulin resistance was not associated with a restoration of the insulin effect on Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylation. However, AICAR enhanced the insulin-induced phosphorylation of the Akt substrate, AS160. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that AICAR reverses the negative effect of BOH on insulin-mediated glucose uptake and this is attributed to activation of a late step in insulin signaling.",0,mouse hippocampal slices (postnatal day 19-44),in vitro; animal,Multi-model,"oxidative metabolism, up",Metabolic Regulation,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"synaptic function, up","Synaptic function, up",partial substitution of glucose in ACSF for beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
22362892,Critical state of energy metabolism in brain slices: the principal role of oxygen delivery and energy substrates in shaping neuronal activity.,"The interactive vasculo-neuro-glial system controlling energy supply in the brain is absent in vitro where energy provision is determined by experimental conditions. Despite the fact that neuronal activity is extremely energy demanding, little has been reported on the state of energy metabolism in submerged brain slices. Without this information, the arbitrarily chosen oxygenation and metabolic provisions make questionable the efficient oxidative metabolism in slices. We show that in mouse hippocampal slices (postnatal day 19-44), evoked neuronal discharges, spontaneous network activity (initiated by 4-aminopyridine), and synaptic stimulation-induced NAD(P)H autofluorescence depend strongly on the oxygen availability. Only the rate of perfusion as high as ~15 ml/min (95% O(2)) provided appropriate oxygenation of a slice. Lower oxygenation resulted in the decrease of both local field potentials and spontaneous network activity as well as in significant modulation of short-term synaptic plasticity. The reduced oxygen supply considerably inhibited the oxidation phase of NAD(P)H signaling indicating that the changes in neuronal activity were paralleled by the decrease in aerobic energy metabolism. Interestingly, the dependence of neuronal activity on oxygen tension was clearly shifted toward considerably larger pO(2) values in slices when compared to in vivo conditions. With sufficient pO(2) provided by a high perfusion rate, partial substitution of glucose in ACSF for beta-hydroxybutyrate, pyruvate, or lactate enhanced both oxidative metabolism and synaptic function. This suggests that the high pO(2) in brain slices is compulsory for maintaining oxidative metabolism, and glucose alone is not sufficient in fulfilling energy requirements during neuronal activity. Altogether, our results demonstrate that energy metabolism determines the functional state of neuronal network, highlighting the need for the adequate metabolic support to be insured in the in vitro experiments.",0; UCP1; LEP,8-wk-old male C57BL/6J mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"mitochondrial biogenesis, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT),Adipose tissue,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Obesity,Metabolic & Endocrine,"body weight, no-change","Body weight, no-change","D-beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol monoester [ketone ester (KE)]",Multi-source,D-BHB

Diets contained equal amounts of fat, protein, and micronutrients. The KE group was fed ad libitum, whereas the control (Ctrl) mice were pair-fed to the KE group. Blood d-beta-hydroxybutyrate levels in the KE group were 3-5 times those reported with high-fat ketogenic diets. Voluntary food intake was reduced dose dependently with the KE diet. Feeding the KE diet for up to 1 mo increased the number of mitochondria and doubled the electron transport chain proteins, uncoupling protein 1, and mitochondrial biogenesis-regulating proteins in the interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT). [(18)F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in IBAT of the KE group was twice that in IBAT of the Ctrl group. Plasma leptin levels of the KE group were more than 2-fold those of the Ctrl group and were associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity to IBAT. The KE group exhibited 14% greater resting energy expenditure, but the total energy expenditure measured over a 24-h period or body weights was not different. The quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index was 73% higher in the KE group.

22457452,GPR109A as an anti-inflammatory receptor in retinal pigment epithelial cells and its relevance to diabetic retinopathy.,"PURPOSE: Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) expresses GPR109A, a receptor for the vitamin niacin and the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB). Because diabetes results in elevated levels of beta-HB, here we studied expression of the receptor in diabetic retina. We also investigated its functional relevance in RPE. METHODS: Retinal expression of GPR109A in diabetic mice and postmortem human eyes was evaluated by quantitative PCR (qPCR). ARPE-19 cells and primary wild-type and Gpr109a(-/-) mouse RPE cells were exposed to TNF-alpha in the presence or absence of niacin or beta-HB, followed by analysis of IL-6 and Ccl2 expression via real-time qPCR and ELISA. RESULTS: GPR109A expression was increased in diabetic mouse and human retina. TNF-alpha increased the expression and secretion of IL-6 and Ccl2 in ARPE-19 cells. Niacin and beta-HB suppressed these effects, implicating GPR109A as the target responsible for mediation of the observed effects. Primary RPE cells from wild-type mice behaved similarly. In contrast, GPR109A ligands failed to suppress TNF-alpha-induced expression and secretion of IL-6 and Ccl2 in primary RPE cells from Gpr109a(-/-) mice, confirming that the observed anti-inflammatory effects were mediated specifically by Gpr109a. CONCLUSIONS: GPR109A plays an anti-inflammatory role in RPE and its expression is upregulated in diabetes. Inflammation is a key causative factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. We speculate that the increased expression of GPR109A and elevation of its ligand beta-HB in diabetes are mechanisms by which the tissue attempts to fight inflammation in this disease. Pharmacological activation of GPR109A may therefore have therapeutic potential in clinical management of diabetic retinopathy.",SLC12A5; SLC12A2,neonatal rat lumbar spinal cord motoneurons; primary afferent terminals,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells,"inadequate energy supply, no-change",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,spinal cord,Spinal cord,motoneurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",dl-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (DL-BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic
22527039,Glucose is an adequate energy substrate for the depolarizing action of GABA and glycine in the neonatal rat spinal cord in vitro.,"In vitro studies have repeatedly demonstrated that the neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine depolarize immature neurons in many areas of the CNS, including the spinal cord. This widely accepted phenomenon was recently challenged by experiments showing that the depolarizing action of GABA on neonatal hippocampus and neocortex in vitro was prevented by adding energy substrates (ES), such as the ketone body metabolite dl-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (DL-BHB), lactate, or pyruvate to the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). It was suggested that GABA-induced depolarizations in vitro might be an artifact due to inadequate energy supply when glucose is the sole energy source, consistent with the energy metabolism of neonatal rat brain being largely dependent on ESs other than glucose. Here we examined the effects of these ESs (DL-BHB, lactate, pyruvate) on inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) recorded from neonatal rat lumbar spinal cord motoneurons (MNs), in vitro. We report that supplementing the ACSF with physiologic concentrations of DL-BHB, lactate, or pyruvate does not alter the reversal potential of IPSPs (E(IPSP)). Only high concentrations of pyruvate hyperpolarized E(IPSP). In addition, the depolarizing action of GABA on primary afferent terminals was not affected by supplementing the ACSF with ES at physiologic concentrations. We conclude that depolarizing IPSPs in immature MNs and the primary afferent depolarizations are not caused by inadequate energy supply. Glucose at its standard concentration appears to be an adequate ES for the neonatal spinal cord in vitro.",CS,Pseudomonas sp.

22613619,Hydroxybutyrate prevents protein aggregation in the halotolerant bacterium Pseudomonas sp. CT13 under abiotic stress.,"Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a typical carbon and energy storage compound, is widely found in Bacteria and Archae domains. This polymer is produced in response to conditions of physiological stress. PHB is composed of repeating units of beta-hydroxybutyrate (R-3HB). It has been previously shown that R-3HB functions as an osmolyte in extremophile strains. In this study, Pseudomonas sp. CT13, a halotolerant bacterium, and its PHB synthase-minus mutant (phaC) were used to analyze the chaperone role of R-3HB. The production of this compound was found to be essential to salt stress resistance and positively correlated with salt concentration, suggesting that PHB monomer acts as a compatible solute in Pseudomonas sp. CT13. R-3HB accumulation was also associated with the prevention of protein aggregation under combined salt and thermal stresses in Pseudomonas sp. CT13. Physiological concentrations of R-3HB efficiently reduced citrate synthase (CS) aggregation and stabilized the enzymatic activities of CS during thermal stress. Docking analysis of the CS/R-3HB interaction predicted the stability of this complex under physiological concentrations of R-3HB. Thus, in vivo, in vitro and in silico analyses suggest that R-3HB can act as a chemical chaperone.",0,rat hippocampal slices,animal; in vitro,Multi-model,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP), prevented impairment","Synaptic plasticity, prevented impairment",acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (1 mM each),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

METHODS: Electrophysiological field potential recordings were used to measure basal synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in rat coronal hippocampal slices. Synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by high-frequency stimulation (100 Hz, 1 second x 3 at an interval of 20 seconds). In addition, mitochondrial complex I function was measured using MitoSOX imaging in mitochondrial preparations. RESULTS: Acute exposure of hippocampal slices to 50 nM rotenone for 1 h did not alter basal CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission though 500 nM rotenone significantly reduced basal synaptic transmission. However, 50 nM rotenone significantly impaired LTP and this rotenone's effect was prevented by co-application of rotenone plus the ketones acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (1 mM each). Finally, we measured mitochondrial function using MitoSOX imaging in mitochondrial preparations and found that 50 nM rotenone partially reduced mitochondrial function whereas 500 nM rotenone completely eliminated mitochondrial function. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that mitochondrial activity driven by complex I is a sensitive modulator of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Acute exposure of the hippocampus to rotenone eliminates complex I function and in turn impairs LTP.",CCL2,U937 human monocyte cell culture,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"MCP-1 secretion, no-change",Inflammation & Immune Response,NS,NS,U937 monocyte,Hematopoietic / Immune,Monocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

Type 1 and some type 2 diabetic patients have elevated levels of the ketone bodies acetoacetate (AA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine how hyperketonemia in diabetic mothers affects markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in their offspring. METHODS: Blood was obtained from 23 diabetic mothers and 13 healthy mothers and their infants' umbilical cords at delivery. Interleukin-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and protein carbonyl (protein oxidation) levels were determined by ELISA. U937 human monocyte cell culture was used to examine the effect of AA and BHB on secretion of MCP-1. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the levels of AA in cord blood of IDMs compared with cord blood of infants of healthy mothers. A significant increase in the levels of protein oxidation (p < 0.05) and MCP-1 levels (p < 0.05) was observed in the cord blood of IDMs. The level of MCP-1 correlated significantly (r = 0.51, p = 0.01) with the concentration of AA in the IDMs. In further experiments with cultured monocytes treated with exogenous AA (0-4 mM), a significant increase in MCP-1 secretion was observed in AA- but not BHB-treated monocytes. CONCLUSION: Blood levels of AA and MCP-1 are elevated in IDMs, which may contribute to the development of the metabolic complications seen in IDMs.",SNCAIP,dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"caspase-activated apoptotic cell death, down",Cell Death & Survival,NS,NS,dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Parkinson's disease,Neurodegenerative,"synphilin-1 aggregation, down","Protein aggregation, down",Na-D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (NabetaHB),Multi-source,D-BHB

Rotenone, a mitochondrial stressor induces caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation leading proteolytic cleavage of substrate nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP cleavage is directly related to apoptotic cell death. In this study, we have monitored the aggregation of green-fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged synphilin-1, as a rotenone-induced Parkinsonia-onset biomarker. We report that the innate ketone body, Na-D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (NabetaHB) reduces markedly the incidence of synphilin-1 aggregation. Furthermore, our data reveal that the metabolic byproduct also prevents rotenone-induced caspase-activated apoptotic cell death in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells. Together, these results suggest that NabetaHB is neuroprotective; it attenuates effects originating from mitochondrial insult and can serve as a scaffold for the design and development of sporadic neuropathies.",CASP3,PC12 cells,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"oxidative stress, down",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,NS,NS,PC12 cells,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"apoptosis, down","Apoptosis, down",d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DbetaHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

It is reported that d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DbetaHB), the major component of ketone bodies, is neuroprotective in recent studies. Therefore, in the present work the neuroprotective effects of DbetaHB on H2O2-induced apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress was investigated. PC12 cells were exposed to H2O2 with different concentrations of H2O2 for different times after DbetaHB pretreatment. MTT assay, apoptotic rates, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, GSH content, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and caspase-3 activity were determined. The results showed that DbetaHB inhibited the decrease of cell viability induced by H2O2 in PC12 cells. DbetaHB decreased the apoptotic rates induced by H2O2. The changes of intracellular ROS, GSH, MMP and caspase-3 activity due to H2O2 exposure were partially reversed in PC12 cells.

23210443,Dioscorea alata attenuates renal interstitial cellular fibrosis by regulating Smad- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition signaling pathways.,"Renal interstitial fibrosis is characterized by increased extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in kidneys is driven by regulated expression of fibrogenic cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Yam, or Dioscorea alata (DA) is an important herb in Chinese medicine widely used for the treatment of clinical diabetes mellitus. However, the fibrosis regulatory effect of DA is unclear. Thus, we examined TGF-beta signaling mechanisms against EMT in rat fibroblast cells (NRK-49F). The characterization of DA water-extracts used various methods; after inducing cellular fibrosis in NRK-49F cells by treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) (10 mM), we used Western blotting to examine the protein expression in the TGF-beta-related signal protein type I and type II TGF-beta receptors, Smads2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3), pSmad2 and Smad3 (pSmad2/3), Smads4, Smads7, and EMT markers. These markers included E-cadherin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Bioactive TGF-beta and fibronectin levels in the culture media were determined using ELISA. Expressions of fibronectin and Snail transcription factor, an EMT-regulatory transcription factor, were assessed by immunofluorescence staining. DA extract dose-dependently (50-200 microg/mL) suppressed beta-HB-induced expression of fibronectin in NRK-49F cells concomitantly with the inhibition of Smad2/3, pSmad2/3, and Smad4. By contrast, Smad7 expression was significantly increased. DA extract caused a decrease in alpha-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin) and MMP-2 levels, and an increase in E-cadherin expression. We propose that DA extract might act as a novel fibrosis antagonist, which acts partly by down regulating the TGF-beta/smad signaling pathway and modulating EMT expression.",ROS1,THP-1 monocytes,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"ROS production, no-change",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,NS,NS,monocytes,Hematopoietic / Immune,Monocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

This study examines the hypothesis that hyperketonemia increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is in part responsible for increased expression of adhesion molecules in monocytes. THP-1 monocytes were treated with acetoacetate (AA) or beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) (0-10 mmol/L) for 24 h. Results show that AA, but not BHB, increases ROS production in monocytes. Pretreatment of monocytes with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibited AA-induced ROS production. AA treatment induced upregulation of LFA-1 and pretreatment of monocytes with NAC or an inhibitor to p38 MAPK inhibited this upregulation in monocytes. This suggests that physiological concentrations of AA can contribute to increased ROS and activation of p38 MAPK, which may be responsible for AA-induced upregulation of LFA-1 in monocytes.

Administration of exogenous betaOHB, or fasting or calorie restriction, two conditions associated with increased betaOHB abundance, all increased global histone acetylation in mouse tissues. Inhibition of HDAC by betaOHB was correlated with global changes in transcription, including that of the genes encoding oxidative stress resistance factors FOXO3A and MT2. Treatment of cells with betaOHB increased histone acetylation at the Foxo3a and Mt2 promoters, and both genes were activated by selective depletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2.

Recently, hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA(2)) was found to be a receptor for a ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB), and is coupled with Gi-GTP binding protein. HCA(2) expression was reported in the guinea pig heart. Therefore, using guinea pig cardiac myocytes, we investigated effects of BHB on L-type Ca(2+) current pre-augmented with beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol under the whole-cell voltage clamp. BHB significantly reduced the Ca(2+) current pre-augmented with isoproterenol. The effect of BHB was concentration dependent with IC(50) of 1.1 mM. Nicotinic acid (NA), another ligand for HCA(2), also exerted an effect on the Ca(2+) current similar to that of BHB. The effects of BHB and NA were reduced by a specific Gi inhibitor, pertussis toxin in the pipette solution. Our results suggest that BHB activates Gi-coupled signal transduction pathway via HCA(2) in guinea pig cardiac myocytes. The HCA(2)-mediated signal transduction may be associated with ketoacidosis-induced cardiac suppression.",0,wild-type hippocampal slices; APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice,animal; in vitro,Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice; Animal – Mouse,"neuronal energy supply, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,brain,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"neuronal hyperexcitability, down","Neuroinflammation, down",pyruvate and 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
23262385,Dietary energy substrates reverse early neuronal hyperactivity in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Deficient energy metabolism and network hyperactivity are the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we show that administration of exogenous oxidative energy substrates (OES) corrects neuronal energy supply deficiency that reduces the amyloid-beta-induced abnormal neuronal activity in vitro and the epileptic phenotype in AD model in vivo. In vitro, acute application of protofibrillar amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) induced aberrant network activity in wild-type hippocampal slices that was underlain by depolarization of both the neuronal resting membrane potential and GABA-mediated current reversal potential. Abeta1-42 also impaired synaptic function and long-term potentiation. These changes were paralleled by clear indications of impaired energy metabolism, as indicated by abnormal NAD(P)H signaling induced by network activity. However, when glucose was supplemented with OES pyruvate and 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate, Abeta1-42 failed to induce detrimental changes in any of the above parameters. We administered the same OES as chronic supplementation to a standard diet to APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice displaying AD-related epilepsy phenotype. In the ex-vivo slices, we found neuronal subpopulations with significantly depolarized resting and GABA-mediated current reversal potentials, mirroring abnormalities we observed under acute Abeta1-42 application. Ex-vivo cortex of transgenic mice fed with standard diet displayed signs of impaired energy metabolism, such as abnormal NAD(P)H signaling and strongly reduced tolerance to hypoglycemia. Transgenic mice also possessed brain glycogen levels twofold lower than those of wild-type mice. However, none of the above neuronal and metabolic dysfunctions were observed in transgenic mice fed with the OES-enriched diet. In vivo, dietary OES supplementation abated neuronal hyperexcitability, as the frequency of both epileptiform discharges and spikes was strongly decreased in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice placed on the diet. Altogether, our results suggest that early AD-related neuronal malfunctions underlying hyperexcitability and energy metabolism deficiency can be prevented by dietary supplementation with native energy substrates.",ALB,human serum albumin,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"molten globule state formation, up",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",3-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

In this paper, we introduce the MG state for HSA upon 21 days incubation with 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate as a ketone body at physiological condition. The results from the HSA sample incubated for 21 days shows a similar secondary structure by CD, more surface hydrophobicity and a little change on tertiary structure by fluorescence, and a larger size by DLS as compared to the native sample or other incubated samples.

This is a key piece of evidence supporting the hypothesis that the anesthetic actions of BHB are due to the metabolite's abilities to alter physical properties of cell membranes, leading to indirect effects on membrane protein function. Pressure-area isotherms show that BHB changes the compressibility of the monolayer and decrease the size of the two-phase coexistence region. Epi-fluorescent microscopy further reveals that the reduction of the coexistence region is due to the significant reduction in morphology of the liquid condensed domains in the two-phase coexistence region. These changes in monolayer morphology are associated with the diminished interfacial viscosity of the monolayers (measured using an interfacial stress rheometer), which gives insight as to how changes in phase and structure may contribute to membrane function.",OXCT1; PPARGC1A; PCK1; PC; 0,mice; SCOT-knock-out (SCOT-KO) neonates,animal,Animal – Mouse,"ketone body oxidation, down",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Hyperketonemic hypoglycemia,Metabolic & Endocrine,"hypoglycemia, down","Blood glucose, down",de novo hepatic beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
23918932,Impact of peripheral ketolytic deficiency on hepatic ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis during the transition to birth.,"Preservation of bioenergetic homeostasis during the transition from the carbohydrate-laden fetal diet to the high fat, low carbohydrate neonatal diet requires inductions of hepatic fatty acid oxidation, gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis. Mice with loss-of-function mutation in the extrahepatic mitochondrial enzyme CoA transferase (succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase, SCOT, encoded by nuclear Oxct1) cannot terminally oxidize ketone bodies and develop lethal hyperketonemic hypoglycemia within 48 h of birth. Here we use this model to demonstrate that loss of ketone body oxidation, an exclusively extrahepatic process, disrupts hepatic intermediary metabolic homeostasis after high fat mother's milk is ingested. Livers of SCOT-knock-out (SCOT-KO) neonates induce the expression of the genes encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1a (PGC-1alpha), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), pyruvate carboxylase, and glucose-6-phosphatase, and the neonate's pools of gluconeogenic alanine and lactate are each diminished by 50%. NMR-based quantitative fate mapping of (13)C-labeled substrates revealed that livers of SCOT-KO newborn mice synthesize glucose from exogenously administered pyruvate. However, the contribution of exogenous pyruvate to the tricarboxylic acid cycle as acetyl-CoA is increased in SCOT-KO livers and is associated with diminished terminal oxidation of fatty acids. After mother's milk provokes hyperketonemia, livers of SCOT-KO mice diminish de novo hepatic beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis by 90%. Disruption of beta-hydroxybutyrate production increases hepatic NAD(+)/NADH ratios 3-fold, oxidizing redox potential in liver but not skeletal muscle. Together, these results indicate that peripheral ketone body oxidation prevents hypoglycemia and supports hepatic metabolic homeostasis, which is critical for the maintenance of glycemia during the adaptation to birth.",MLXIPL; 0,starved liver; high fat-fed liver; hepatocytes,animal; in vitro,NS; Animal – Other Mammal; In vitro – Primary cells,"nuclear localization, down",Other / Unspecified,liver,Liver,hepatocytes,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,cytoplasm,Cytosol,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"fat synthesis, down","Fat synthesis, down",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
24323418,Metabolite regulation of nucleo-cytosolic trafficking of carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP): role of ketone bodies.,"The carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) is a glucose-responsive transcription factor that plays a critical role in converting excess carbohydrate to storage fat in liver. In response to changing glucose levels, ChREBP activity is regulated by nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of ChREBP via interactions with 14-3-3 proteins and importins. The nuclear/cytosol trafficking is regulated partly by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of serine 196 mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein phosphatase. We show here that protein-free extracts of starved and high fat-fed livers contain metabolites that activate interaction of ChREBP.14-3-3 and inhibit the ChREBP/importin alpha interaction, resulting in cytosolic localization. These metabolites were identified as beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. Nuclear localization of GFP-ChREBP is rapidly inhibited in hepatocytes incubated in beta-hydroxybutyrate or fatty acids, and the observed inhibition is closely correlated with the production of ketone bodies. These observations show that ketone bodies play an important role in the regulation of ChREBP activity by restricting ChREBP localization to the cytoplasm, thus inhibiting fat synthesis during periods of ketosis.",0,rat cortical neurons (DIV 14); rat cortical neurons (DIV 7),animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"respiratory capacity, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,cortex,Brain/CNS,cortical neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",exogenous (1.0-10.0 mM),In vitro media supplementation,NS
24379353,Augmentation of normal and glutamate-impaired neuronal respiratory capacity by exogenous alternative biofuels.,"Mitochondrial respiratory capacity is critical for responding to changes in neuronal energy demand. One approach toward neuroprotection is the administration of alternative energy substrates (""biofuels"") to overcome brain injury-induced inhibition of glucose-based aerobic energy metabolism. This study tested the hypothesis that exogenous pyruvate, lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetyl-L-carnitine each increase neuronal respiratory capacity in vitro either in the absence of or following transient excitotoxic glutamate receptor stimulation. Compared to the presence of 5 mM glucose alone, the addition of pyruvate, lactate, or beta-hydroxybutyrate (1.0-10.0 mM) to either day in vitro (DIV) 14 or 7 rat cortical neurons resulted in significant, dose-dependent stimulation of respiratory capacity, measured by cell respirometry as the maximal O2 consumption rate in the presence of the respiratory uncoupler carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. A 30-min exposure to 100 muM glutamate impaired respiratory capacity for DIV 14, but not DIV 7, neurons. Glutamate reduced the respiratory capacity for DIV 14 neurons with glucose alone by 25 % and also reduced respiratory capacity with glucose plus pyruvate, lactate, or beta-hydroxybutyrate. However, respiratory capacity in glutamate-exposed neurons following pyruvate or beta-hydroxybutyrate addition was still, at least, as high as that obtained with glucose alone in the absence of glutamate exposure. These results support the interpretation that previously observed neuroprotection by exogenous pyruvate, lactate, or beta-hydroxybutyrate is at least partially mediated by their preservation of neuronal respiratory capacity.",0,rats; dissociated VMH neurons,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells,"astrocyte ketone production, up",Metabolic Regulation,ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH),Brain/CNS,astrocytes,Neural / Glial,Astrocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"caloric intake, down","Food intake, down",NS,NS,NS
24524836,Regulation of hypothalamic neuronal sensing and food intake by ketone bodies and fatty acids.,"Metabolic sensing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) alter their activity when ambient levels of metabolic substrates, such as glucose and fatty acids (FA), change. To assess the relationship between a high-fat diet (HFD; 60%) intake on feeding and serum and VMH FA levels, rats were trained to eat a low-fat diet (LFD; 13.5%) or an HFD in 3 h/day and were monitored with VMH FA microdialysis. Despite having higher serum levels, HFD rats had lower VMH FA levels but ate less from 3 to 6 h of refeeding than did LFD rats. However, VMH beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) and VMH-to-serum beta-OHB ratio levels were higher in HFD rats during the first 1 h of refeeding, suggesting that VMH astrocyte ketone production mediated their reduced intake. In fact, using calcium imaging in dissociated VMH neurons showed that ketone bodies overrode normal FA sensing, primarily by exciting neurons that were activated or inhibited by oleic acid. Importantly, bilateral inhibition of VMH ketone production with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase inhibitor reversed the 3- to 6-h HFD-induced inhibition of intake but had no effect in LFD-fed rats. These data suggest that a restricted HFD intake regimen inhibits caloric intake as a consequence of FA-induced VMH ketone body production by astrocytes.",0,rat; AMPA-perfused lumbar spinal cord,animal,Animal – Rat; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"energy metabolism, up",Metabolic Regulation,lumbar spinal cord,Spinal cord,motor neuron,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"motor neuron loss, down; motor function, up; paralysis, down","Neuronal survival, down; Motor function, up; Neurological deficit score, down",NS,NS,NS
24535268,Role of energy metabolic deficits and oxidative stress in excitotoxic spinal motor neuron degeneration in vivo.,"MN (motor neuron) death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may be mediated by glutamatergic excitotoxicity. Previously, our group showed that the microdialysis perfusion of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) in the rat lumbar spinal cord induced MN death and permanent paralysis within 12 h after the experiment. Here, we studied the involvement of energy metabolic deficiencies and of oxidative stress in this MN degeneration, by testing the neuroprotective effect of various energy metabolic substrates and antioxidants. Pyruvate, lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, alpha-ketobutyrate and creatine reduced MN loss by 50-65%, preserved motor function and completely prevented the paralysis. Ascorbate, glutathione and glutathione ethyl ester weakly protected against motor deficits and reduced MN death by only 30-40%. Reactive oxygen species formation and 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity were studied 1.5-2 h after AMPA perfusion, during the initial MN degenerating process, and no changes were observed. We conclude that mitochondrial energy deficiency plays a crucial role in this excitotoxic spinal MN degeneration, whereas oxidative stress seems a less relevant mechanism. Interestingly, we observed a clear correlation between the alterations of motor function and the number of damaged MNs, suggesting that there is a threshold of about 50% in the number of healthy MNs necessary to preserve motor function.",0; ALB,human serum albumin (HSA),in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"AGEs formation, down",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",produced by the liver,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

The 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (3BHB), a ketone body which is produced by the liver, can be detected in increased concentrations in individuals post fasting and prolonged exercises and in diabetic (type I) patients. In this study, the inhibitory effect of 3BHB on AGEs formation by glucose from the human serum albumin (HSA) was studied at physiological conditions after 35 days of incubation, using physical techniques such as circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The fluorescence intensity measurements of glycated HSA by glucose (GHSA) in the presence of 3BHB indicate a decrease in AGEs formation. The DSC deconvolution profile results also confirm the protective role of 3BHB on incubated with glucose by preventing the enthalpy reduction of the HSA tail segment, compared with the deconvolution profile seen for incubated with glucose alone. The concentration of 3BHB used in this study is in accordance with the concentration detected in the body of individuals post fasting and prolonged exercises.",ICAM1; ROS1,Human umbilical vein endothelial cells; THP-1 monocytes,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"ROS production, up",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,endothelium,Vasculature,human umbilical vein endothelial cells,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Endothelial dysfunction,Cardiovascular,"monocyte adhesion, up","Monocyte adhesion, up","ketones (AA or BHB, 0-4 mM)",In vitro media supplementation,NS

T1D patients have a greater risk of developing endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Supplementation with cysteine-rich milk proteins has been shown to be beneficial in improving various biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and CVD. This study examines whether L-cysteine (LC) per se prevents monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, a critical step in endothelial dysfunction. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and THP-1 monocytes were pretreated with and without LC (500 muM) for 2 h and then exposed to ketones (AA or BHB, 0-4 mM) and/or high glucose (HG) (25 mM) for 24 h. This study shows that LC reduces HG and ketone-induced ROS production, ICAM-1 expression, and the adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. This study provides a biochemical mechanism by which milk protein supplementation can be beneficial in preventing the excess endothelial dysfunction and CVD seen in diabetic patients.",0,male ICR mice (postnatal day 49),animal,Animal – Mouse,"anticonvulsant effects, up",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"latency to onset of seizures, up","Seizure activity, up",injected intraperitoneally with BHB (20 mmol/kg),Intraperitoneal BHB,NS
24780902,Anticonvulsant Effects of beta-Hydroxybutyrate in Mice.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ketogenic diet was formulated to mimic the biochemical changes seen upon fasting, specifically the formation of ketone bodies. Recent research data suggest that the anticonvulsant efficacy of the KD may be due in part to the direct actions of ketone bodies. This study was designed to investigate the anticonvulsant effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on pilocarpine-induced seizures in mature mice. METHODS: Eighty-two male ICR mice at postnatal day 49 were used. All mice were pretreated with scopolamine methylbromide prior to pilocarpine injection. Experimental mice (n=42) were injected intraperitoneally with BHB (20 mmol/kg) 15 min prior to pilocarpine administration, while control animals (n=40) with normal saline. Pilocarpine (300 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally and mice were monitored for 2 h after pilocarpine injection. RESULTS: All mice developed typical seizure behaviors. The mean (+/-SD) latency to the onset of seizures was significantly prolonged in the BHB-treated mice compared with controls (4.83+/-1.95 min vs. 3.67+/-1.90 min, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that treatment with BHB prolongs the latency to the onset of seizures induced by pilocarpine in mature mice and suggests that BHB, one of the ketone bodies, may have direct anticonvulsant effects.",0,rats fasted 36 hours; awake ex vivo; pentobarbital-induced isoelectricity ex vivo; halothane-anesthetized in vivo,animal,Animal – Rat; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice; NS,"neuronal acetyl-CoA oxidation, up",Metabolic Regulation,neocortex,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"neuronal energy support, up","Neuroprotection, up","[2,4-(13)C(2)]-D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB
24789366,The contribution of ketone bodies to basal and activity-dependent neuronal oxidation in vivo.,"The capacity of ketone bodies to replace glucose in support of neuronal function is unresolved. Here, we determined the contributions of glucose and ketone bodies to neocortical oxidative metabolism over a large range of brain activity in rats fasted 36 hours and infused intravenously with [2,4-(13)C(2)]-D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Three animal groups and conditions were studied: awake ex vivo, pentobarbital-induced isoelectricity ex vivo, and halothane-anesthetized in vivo, the latter data reanalyzed from a recent study. Rates of neuronal acetyl-CoA oxidation from ketone bodies (V(acCoA-kbN)) and pyruvate (V(pdhN)), and the glutamate-glutamine cycle (V(cyc)) were determined by metabolic modeling of (13)C label trapped in major brain amino acid pools. V(acCoA-kbN) increased gradually with increasing activity, as compared with the steeper change in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle rate (V(tcaN)), supporting a decreasing percentage of neuronal ketone oxidation: approximately 100% (isoelectricity), 56% (halothane anesthesia), 36% (awake) with the BHB plasma levels achieved in our experiments (6 to 13 mM). In awake animals ketone oxidation reached saturation for blood levels >17 mM, accounting for 62% of neuronal substrate oxidation, the remainder (38%) provided by glucose. We conclude that ketone bodies present at sufficient concentration to saturate metabolism provides full support of basal (housekeeping) energy needs and up to approximately half of the activity-dependent oxidative needs of neurons.",0,rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"energy substrate protection, up",Metabolic Regulation,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,pyramidal neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"latency to onset of status epilepticus, up; hippocampal neuronal death, down","Seizure activity, up; Neuronal survival, down",DL- and L-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic
24789919,Energy substrates protect hippocampus against endogenous glutamate-mediated neurodegeneration in awake rats.,"Excitotoxicity due to excessive glutamatergic neurotransmission is a well-studied phenomenon that has been related to the mechanisms of neuronal death occurring in some disorders of the CNS. We have previously shown that the intrahippocampal perfusion by microdialysis of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in rats stimulates endogenous glutamate release from nerve endings and this results in excitotoxic effects such as immediate seizures and delayed neuronal death, due to the overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. To study whether mitochondrial energy dysfunction and oxidative stress could be involved in this 4-AP-induced excitotoxicity, we evaluated in awake rats the protective effect of several energy substrates and antioxidant compounds, using microdialysis, electroencephalographic (EEG) recording and histological analysis. The 4-AP-induced behavioral and EEG seizures, which progressed to status epilepticus in about 30 min, were prevented by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801, whereas acetoacetate, DL- and L-beta-hydroxybutyrate did not protect against seizures but increased the latency to the onset of status epilepticus; pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate and glutathione ethyl ester did not show any protective effect. 4-AP also produced nearly complete loss of pyramidal neurons in CA1 and CA3 regions of the ipsilateral hippocampus 24 h after the experiment. MK-801 totally prevented this neuronal death and the energy substrates tested protected by about 50%, whereas the antioxidants showed only a weak protection. We conclude that ketone bodies possess weak anticonvulsant effects and that energy metabolism impairment plays a more important role than oxidative stress in the delayed hippocampal neurodegeneration resulting from the excitotoxic action of 4-AP mediated by endogenous glutamate.",UCP1,murine white adipose cells; human cells; in vivo,animal; human; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells; NS,"redox state modification, NS",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,adipose tissue,Adipose tissue,white adipose cells,Adipose,White adipocytes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketone body,NS,NS
24845831,Browning of white adipose cells by intermediate metabolites: an adaptive mechanism to alleviate redox pressure.,"The presence of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in human adults opens attractive perspectives to treat metabolic disorders. Indeed, BAT dissipates energy as heat via uncoupling protein (UCP)1. Brown adipocytes are located in specific deposits or can emerge among white fat through the so-called browning process. Although numerous inducers have been shown to drive this process, no study has investigated whether it could be controlled by specific metabolites. Here, we show that lactate, an important metabolic intermediate, induces browning of murine white adipose cells with expression of functional UCP1. Lactate-induced browning also occurs in human cells and in vivo. Lactate controls Ucp1 expression independently of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and PPARalpha pathways but requires active PPARgamma signaling. We demonstrate that the lactate effect on Ucp1 is mediated by intracellular redox modifications as a result of lactate transport through monocarboxylate transporters. Further, the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate, another metabolite that impacts redox state, is also a strong browning inducer. Because this redox-dependent increase in Ucp1 expression promotes an oxidative phenotype with mitochondria, browning appears as an adaptive mechanism to alleviate redox pressure. Our findings open new perspectives for the control of adipose tissue browning and its physiological relevance.",HCAR2; PTGS1; HPGDS,Hca2(-/-) mice; chimeric mice; stroke model,animal,Animal – Mouse; NS,"HCA2 activation, required",Inflammation & Immune Response,ischemic brain,Brain/CNS,Ly-6C(Lo) monocytes and/or macrophages,Unspecified / Mixed,Mixed cell population,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Stroke; nan,Cerebrovascular / Stroke; Neurodegenerative,"infarct size, down","Infarct size, down",endogenous; ketogenic diet,NS; Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
24858472,The beta-hydroxybutyrate receptor HCA2 activates a neuroprotective subset of macrophages.,"The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is an endogenous factor protecting against stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, but its mode of action is unclear. Here we show in a stroke model that the hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2, GPR109A) is required for the neuroprotective effect of BHB and a ketogenic diet, as this effect is lost in Hca2(-/-) mice. We further demonstrate that nicotinic acid, a clinically used HCA2 agonist, reduces infarct size via a HCA2-mediated mechanism, and that noninflammatory Ly-6C(Lo) monocytes and/or macrophages infiltrating the ischemic brain also express HCA2. Using cell ablation and chimeric mice, we demonstrate that HCA2 on monocytes and/or macrophages is required for the protective effect of nicotinic acid. The activation of HCA2 induces a neuroprotective phenotype of monocytes and/or macrophages that depends on PGD2 production by COX1 and the haematopoietic PGD2 synthase. Our data suggest that HCA2 activation by dietary or pharmacological means instructs Ly-6C(Lo) monocytes and/or macrophages to deliver a neuroprotective signal to the brain.",SLC27A1,mouse gastrocnemius; C2C12 myotubes; newborn mice (adenovirus in hindlimb); isolated mouse gastrocnemius strips,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"ketone body oxidation, down",Metabolic Regulation,skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius),Skeletal muscle,C2C12 myotubes,Muscle – Skeletal,Myoblasts,mitochondria (outer membrane and intermembrane),Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, up","Blood ketones (BHB), up",NS,NS,NS

Here, we examine FATP1 localization and metabolic effects of its overexpression in mouse skeletal muscle. The FATP1 protein was detected in mitochondrial and plasma membrane fractions, obtained by differential centrifugation, of mouse gastrocnemius muscle. FATP1 was most abundant in purified mitochondria, and in the outer membrane and soluble intermembrane, but not in the inner membrane plus matrix, enriched subfractions of purified mitochondria. Immunogold electron microscopy localized FATP1-GFP in mitochondria of transfected C2C12 myotubes. FATP1 was overexpressed in gastrocnemius mouse muscle, by adenovirus-mediated delivery of the gene into hindlimb muscles of newborn mice, fed after weaning a chow or high-fat diet. Compared to GFP delivery, FATP1 did not alter body weight, serum fed glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels, and whole-body glucose tolerance, in either diet. However, fatty acid levels were lower and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were higher in FATP1- than GFP-mice, irrespective of diet. Moreover, intramuscular triglyceride content was lower in FATP1- versus GFP-mice regardless of diet, and beta-hydroxybutyrate content was unchanged in high-fat-fed mice. Electroporation-mediated FATP1 overexpression enhanced palmitate oxidation to CO2, but not to acid-soluble intermediate metabolites, while CO2 production from beta-hydroxybutyrate was inhibited and that from glucose unchanged, in isolated mouse gastrocnemius strips. In summary, FATP1 was localized in mitochondria, in the outer membrane and intermembrane parts, of mouse skeletal muscle, what may be crucial for its metabolic effects. Overexpressed FATP1 enhanced disposal of both systemic fatty acids and intramuscular triglycerides. Consistently, it did not contribute to the high-fat diet-induced metabolic dysregulation. However, FATP1 lead to hyperketonemia, likely secondary to the sparing of ketone body oxidation by the enhanced oxidation of fatty acids.",0,rat hippocampal slices,animal; in vitro,Multi-model,"alternative energy substrate, up",Metabolic Regulation,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"population spike recovery, up","Neuroprotection, up",NS,NS,NS

However, there are limitations in clinical application of these diets and attention has turned to understanding their mechanism of action. Ketone bodies are produced in both diets and maybe involved in their ability to attenuate neuronal injury. This study seeks to assess the effects of ketone bodies on neuronal transmission and their efficacy in reducing the impact of known excitotoxins. We made use of extracellular recordings from rat hippocampal slices and demonstrate that ketone bodies had no effect on neuronal transmission or induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Perfusion of slices with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA, 15 muM) produced neuronal depression suggestive of cell injury (antidromic recording also demonstrated similar depression), such that recovery of population spike potentials after 60 minutes was 27% in normal (10 mM) glucose but only 7% during reduced (2.5 mM) glucose availability. Experiments in ketone bodies demonstrated improved recovery (31%) but only under conditions of low glucose. Similarly, there was enhanced recovery of slices treated with kainic acid (KA, 30 muM) in reduced glucose media (13-27%), but no difference in normal glucose. These findings suggest that ketone bodies do not alter neuronal function but can alter the response to excitotoxins when energy supplies are impaired, probably by acting as an alternative energy substrate.",0; HDAC3; BDH1; SNCA,C. elegans nematodes,animal,Animal – Invertebrate,"HDAC inhibition, down",Epigenetic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease; Parkinson's disease,Neurodegenerative,"amyloid-beta toxicity, down; alpha-synuclein aggregation, down; glucose toxicity, down (partial); lifespan, up; thermotolerance, up","Neuroprotection, down; alpha-synuclein aggregation, down; Blood glucose, down (partial); Lifespan, up; Thermogenesis, up",betaHB supplementation,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

Therefore we determined the effect of betaHB supplementation on the lifespan ofC. elegans nematodes. betaHB supplementation extended mean lifespan by approximately 20%. RNAi knockdown of HDACs hda-2 or hda-3 also increased lifespan and further prevented betaHB-mediated lifespan extension. betaHB-mediated lifespan extension required the DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/Nrf longevity pathways, the sirtuin SIR-2.1, and the AMP kinase subunit AAK-2. betaHB did not extend lifespan in a genetic model of dietary restriction indicating that betaHB is likely functioning through a similar mechanism. betaHB addition also upregulated BetaHB dehydrogenase activity and increased oxygen consumption in the worms. RNAi knockdown of F55E10.6, a short chain dehydrogenase and SKN-1 target gene, prevented the increased lifespan and betaHB dehydrogenase activity induced by betaHB addition, suggesting that F55E10.6 functions as an inducible betaHB dehydrogenase. Furthermore, betaHB supplementation increased worm thermotolerance and partially prevented glucose toxicity. It also delayed Alzheimer's amyloid-beta toxicity and decreased Parkinson's alpha-synuclein aggregation.

25279990,Reduced glucose utilization underlies seizure protection with dietary therapy in epileptic EL mice.,"Dietary therapy has been used to treat many individuals with epilepsy whose seizures are refractory to antiepileptic drugs. The mechanisms for how dietary therapy confers seizure protection are currently not well understood. We evaluated the acute effects of glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate (the major circulating ketone body) in conferring seizure protection to the EL mouse, a model of multifactorial idiopathic generalized epilepsy. EL mice were fed either an unrestricted standard diet or a calorie-restricted standard diet to achieve a body weight reduction of 20-23%. D-Glucose, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, and beta-hydroxybutyrate were supplemented in the drinking water of calorie-restricted mice for 2.5 h prior to seizure testing to simulate the effect of increased glucose availability, decreased glucose utilization, and increased ketone availability, respectively. Seizure susceptibility, body weight, plasma glucose, and beta-hydroxybutyrate were measured over a nine-week treatment period. Additionally, excitatory and inhibitory amino acids were measured in the brains of mice using (1)H NMR. Glutamate decarboxylase activity was also measured to evaluate the connection between dietary therapy and brain metabolism. We found that lowering of glucose utilization is necessary to confer seizure protection with long-term (>4 weeks) calorie restriction, whereas increased ketone availability did not affect seizure susceptibility. In the absence of long-term calorie restriction, however, reduced glucose utilization and increased ketone availability did not affect seizure susceptibility. Brain excitatory and inhibitory amino acid content did not change with treatment, and glutamate decarboxylase activity was not associated with seizure susceptibility. We demonstrated that reduced glucose utilization is necessary to confer seizure protection under long-term calorie restriction in EL mice, while acute ketone supplementation did not confer seizure protection. Further studies are needed to uncover the mechanisms by which glucose utilization influences seizure susceptibility.",0,three-week-old rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,brain,Brain/CNS,neuron,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypoglycemia-induced neuronal injury,Neurodegenerative,"neuronal injury, down","Brain injury, down",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
25301680,Hyperglycemia accentuates and ketonemia attenuates hypoglycemia-induced neuronal injury in the developing rat brain.,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged hypoglycemia leads to brain injury, despite treatment with 10% dextrose. Whether induction of hyperglycemia or ketonemia achieves better neuroprotection is unknown. Hyperglycemia is neuroprotective in other brain injuries during development; however, it worsens hypoglycemia-induced injury in the adult brain via poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) overactivation. METHODS: Three-week-old rats were subjected to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and treated with 10% dextrose or 50% dextrose. Neuronal injury, PARP-1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) III/TrkB/p75(NTR) expressions were determined. In the second experiment, ketonemia was induced by administering beta-hydroxybutyrate during hypoglycemia and its effect on neuronal injury was compared with those conventionally treated using 10% dextrose. RESULTS: Both 10 and 50% dextrose administration led to hyperglycemia (50% dextrose > 10% dextrose). Compared with the 10% dextrose group, neuronal injury was greater in the 50% dextrose group and was accompanied by PARP-1 overactivation. BDNF III and p75(NTR), but not TrkBFL, mRNA expressions were upregulated. Neuronal injury was less severe in the rats subjected to ketonemia, compared with those conventionally treated using 10% dextrose. CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia accentuated hypoglycemia-induced neuronal injury, likely via PARP-1 overactivation. Although BDNF was upregulated, it was not neuroprotective and potentially exaggerated injury by binding to p75(NTR) receptor. Conversely, ketonemia during hypoglycemia attenuated neuronal injury.",0,patient with Alzheimer's disease dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination score 12),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"bypass metabolic blocks to glucose utilization, NS",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"mood, up; affect, up; self-care, up; cognitive performance, up; daily activity performance, up","Depressive-like behavior, up; Anxiety-like behavior, up; Self-care, up; Cognitive performance, up; Locomotor activity, up",ketone monoester (KME),Ketone ester (KE),NS

For this, plasma ketones must be elevated well above the </= 0.2 mM default concentrations normally prevalent. Limitations of dietary methods currently used to produce therapeutic hyperketonemia have stimulated the search for better approaches. METHOD: Described herein is a new way to produce therapeutic hyperketonemia, entailing prolonged oral administration of a potent ketogenic agent--ketone monoester (KME)--to a patient with Alzheimer's disease dementia and a pretreatment Mini-Mental State Examination score of 12. RESULTS: The patient improved markedly in mood, affect, self-care, and cognitive and daily activity performance. The KME was well tolerated throughout the 20-month treatment period. Cognitive performance tracked plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, with noticeable improvements in conversation and interaction at the higher levels, compared with predose levels.

25415176,The metabolic impact of beta-hydroxybutyrate on neurotransmission: Reduced glycolysis mediates changes in calcium responses and KATP channel receptor sensitivity.,"Glucose is the main energy substrate for neurons, and ketone bodies are known to be alternative substrates. However, the capacity of ketone bodies to support different neuronal functions is still unknown. Thus, a change in energy substrate from glucose alone to a combination of glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate might change neuronal function as there is a known coupling between metabolism and neurotransmission. The purpose of this study was to shed light on the effects of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate on glycolysis and neurotransmission in cultured murine glutamatergic neurons. Previous studies have shown an effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate on glucose metabolism, and the present study further specified this by showing attenuation of glycolysis when beta-hydroxybutyrate was present in these neurons. In addition, the NMDA receptor-induced calcium responses in the neurons were diminished in the presence of beta-hydroxybutyrate, whereas a direct effect of the ketone body on transmitter release was absent. However, the presence of beta-hydroxybutyrate augmented transmitter release induced by the KATP channel blocker glibenclamide, thus giving an indirect indication of the involvement of KATP channels in the effects of ketone bodies on transmitter release. Energy metabolism and neurotransmission are linked and involve ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP ) channels. However, it is still unclear how and to what degree available energy substrate affects this link. We investigated the effect of changing energy substrate from only glucose to a combination of glucose and R-beta-hydroxybutyrate in cultured neurons. Using the latter combination, glycolysis was diminished, NMDA receptor-induced calcium responses were lower, and the KATP channel blocker glibenclamide caused a higher transmitter release.",INS; GCG,Healthy post-absorptive males (n=6),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"glucose production, down",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"glucose production, down; lipolysis, down","Blood glucose, down; Lipolysis, down",HOB infusion,Intravenous BHB,D-BHB

Moreover, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (HOB) is suggested to reduce blood glucose and fatty acid levels. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to quantitate systemic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle HOB utilization and its effect on energy metabolism. DESIGN: Single trial. SETTING: Hospital. PARTICIPANT: Healthy post-absorptive males (n = 6). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were studied under basal condition and three consecutive 1-hour periods with a 3-, 6-, and 12-fold increased HOB concentration via HOB infusion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Systemic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle HOB kinetics, oxidation, glucose turnover, and lipolysis via arterial, jugular, and femoral venous differences in combination with stable isotopically labeled HOB, glucose, and glycerol, infusion. RESULTS: An increase in HOB from the basal 160-450 mumol/L elicited 14 +/- 2% reduction (P = .03) in glucose appearance and 37 +/- 4% decrease (P = .03) in lipolytic rate while insulin and glucagon were unchanged. Endogenous HOB appearance was reduced in a dose-dependent manner with complete inhibition at the highest HOB concentration (1.7 mmol/L). Cerebral HOB uptake and subsequent oxidation was linearly related to the arterial HOB concentration. Resting skeletal muscle HOB uptake showed saturation kinetics. CONCLUSION: A small increase in the HOB concentration decreases glucose production and lipolysis in post-absorptive healthy males. Moreover, cerebral HOB uptake and oxidation rates are linearly related to the arterial HOB concentration of importance for modifying brain energy utilization, potentially of relevance for patients with epileptic seizures and dementia.",SIRT1,Csb(m/m) mice; nematodes; human cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Invertebrate; In vitro – Primary cells,"SIRT1 activation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Cockayne syndrome,Genetic / Congenital,"CS-associated phenotypes, rescued","Phenotype, rescued",high-fat diet,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

Since dietary interventions can alter neurodegenerative processes, Csb(m/m) mice were given a high-fat, caloric-restricted, or resveratrol-supplemented diet. High-fat feeding rescued the metabolic, transcriptomic, and behavioral phenotypes of Csb(m/m) mice. Furthermore, premature aging in CS mice, nematodes, and human cells results from aberrant PARP activation due to deficient DNA repair leading to decreased SIRT1 activity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, beta-hydroxybutyrate levels are increased by the high-fat diet, and beta-hydroxybutyrate, PARP inhibition, or NAD(+) supplementation can activate SIRT1 and rescue CS-associated phenotypes. Mechanistically, CSB can displace activated PARP1 from damaged DNA to limit its activity. This study connects two emerging longevity metabolites, beta-hydroxybutyrate and NAD(+), through the deacetylase SIRT1 and suggests possible interventions for CS.",KCNJ11; 0,mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) brain slices,animal; in vitro,Multi-model,"nonselective cationic conductance, down",Ion & Nutrient Transport,substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr),Brain/CNS,GABAergic neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

To determine whether neuronal pacemaking depends on active glucose metabolism, we switched the metabolic fuel from glucose to alternative fuels, lactate or beta-hydroxybutyrate, while monitoring the spontaneous firing of GABAergic neurons in mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) brain slices. We found that alternative fuels, in the absence of glucose, sustained SNr spontaneous firing at basal rates, but glycolysis may still be supported by glycogen in the absence of glucose. To prevent any glycogen-fueled glycolysis, we directly inhibited glycolysis using either 2-deoxyglucose or iodoacetic acid. Inhibiting glycolysis in the presence of alternative fuels lowered SNr firing to a slower sustained firing rate. Surprisingly, we found that the decrease in SNr firing was not mediated by ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel activity, but if we lowered the perfusion flow rate or omitted the alternative fuel, KATP channels were activated and could silence SNr firing. The KATP-independent slowing of SNr firing that occurred with glycolytic inhibition in the presence of alternative fuels was consistent with a decrease in a nonselective cationic conductance. Although mitochondrial metabolism alone can prevent severe energy deprivation and KATP channel activation in SNr neurons, active glucose metabolism appears important for keeping open a class of ion channels that is crucial for the high spontaneous firing rate of SNr neurons.",0,HUVECs,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"NF-kappaB activation, no-change",Inflammation & Immune Response,endothelial cells,Vasculature,HUVECs,Endothelial,Venous endothelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",BHB (0-10 mM),In vitro media supplementation,NS
25591777,Effect of hyperketonemia (Acetoacetate) on nuclear factor-kappaB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation mediated intercellular adhesion molecule 1 upregulation in endothelial cells.,"BACKGROUND: Hyperketonemia is a pathological condition observed in patients with type 1 diabetes and ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD), which results in increased blood levels of acetoacetate (AA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Frequent episodes of hyperketonemia are associated with a higher incidence of vascular disease. We examined the hypothesis that hyperketonemia activates the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways that regulate intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression in endothelial cells. METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured with AA (0-8 mM) or BHB (0-10 mM) for 0-24 hr. Western blotting was used to determine NF-kappaB activation in whole-cell lysates. ICAM-1 expression was measured using flow cytometry. RESULTS: RESULTS show a 2.4-fold increase in NF-kappaB activation in cells treated with 8 mM AA compared to the control. BHB had little or no effect on NF-kappaB activation. Pretreatment with a reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor [N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC)] reduced NF-kappaB to near-control levels. The expression of AA-induced ICAM-1 was significantly reduced when cells were pretreated with either NAC or p38 MAPK inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK mediate upregulation of ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells exposed to elevated levels of AA, which may contribute to the development of vascular disease in diabetes.",0; ICAM1,HUVEC,human; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"NOX upregulation, up",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,microvasculature,Vasculature,HUVEC,Endothelial,Venous endothelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Type 1 diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"cellular injury, up","Brain injury, up",NS,NS,NS

Hyperketonemia (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate) is frequently found along with hyperglycemia in T1D. Whether hyperketonemia per se contributes to the excess oxidative stress and cellular injury observed in T1D is not known. METHODS: HUVEC were treated with ketones in the presence or absence of high glucose for 24 h. NOX4 siRNA was used to specifically knockdown NOX4 expression in HUVEC. RESULTS: Ketones alone or in combination with high glucose treatment cause a significant increase in oxidative stress, ICAM-1, and monocyte adhesivity to HUVEC. Using an antisense approach, we show that ketone induced increases in ROS, ICAM-1 expression, and monocyte adhesion in endothelial cells were prevented in NOX4 knockdown cells. CONCLUSION: This study reports that elevated levels of ketones upregulate NOX, contributing to increased oxidative stress, ICAM-1 levels, and cellular dysfunction. This provides a novel biochemical mechanism that elucidates the role of hyperketonemia in the excess cellular injury in T1D. New drugs targeting inhibition of NOX seems promising in preventing higher risk of complications associated with T1D.",0,rat; cortical cultures,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells,"mitochondrial function, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,cortex,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Hypoglycemia,Metabolic & Endocrine,"neuronal death, down","Neuronal survival, down",systemic administration of D-BHB; D-BHB; L-BHB,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

It has been shown that KB prevent neuronal death induced during energy limiting conditions and excitotoxicity. The protective effect of KB has been mainly attributed to the improvement of mitochondrial function. In the present study, we have investigated the protective effect of D-BHB against neuronal death induced by severe noncoma hypoglycemia in the rat in vivo and by glucose deprivation (GD) in cortical cultures. Results show that systemic administration of D-BHB reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in distinct cortical areas and subregions of the hippocampus and efficiently prevents neuronal death in the cortex of hypoglycemic animals. In vitro results show that D-BHB stimulates ATP production and reduces ROS levels, while the nonphysiologic isomer of BHB, L-BHB, has no effect on energy production but reduces ROS levels. Data suggest that protection by BHB, not only results from its metabolic action but is also related to its capability to reduce ROS, rendering this KB as a suitable candidate for the treatment of ischemic and traumatic injury.",GPT; GOT1; 0; LDHA,porcine hemorrhagic shock/polytrauma model; healthy pigs,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Multi-disease,"survival, no-change","Survival, no-change",D-ss-hydroxybutyrate and melatonin; intravenous and intraosseous infusion,NS; Multi-source,D-BHB

Here, we evaluated the safety of BHB/M via 2 routes of administration in a porcine hemorrhagic shock/polytrauma model. Furthermore, we assessed BHB/M serum concentrations after intravenous and intraosseous infusion of different BHB/M doses in healthy pigs. Pigs underwent pulmonary contusion, liver injury, and hemorrhage. Injured animals were treated with an intravenous or intraosseous bolus of BHB/M or lactated Ringer's solution (LR), followed by 4 h of continuous infusion of the respective fluid (n = 12 per group). Pigs were resuscitated with LR (1 h) and then LR and shed blood (20 h). Physiological data and blood samples were analyzed throughout the experiment. In a second study, we infused healthy pigs intravenously or intraosseously with BHB/M at 3 different doses (n = 4 per group). There were no differences between groups in physiologic measurements (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and cardiac output), organ function markers (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, serum urea nitrogen, total creatinine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase), or histopathology. The BHB/M-treated animals exhibited transient changes in blood Na, K, pH, and lactate. Differences in survival were not statistically significant. There was a trend toward decreased survival after intraosseous infusion, potentially related to lower circulating BHB and melatonin levels. Healthy pigs had higher drug serum concentrations after intravenous than after intraosseous infusion of BHB/M at the standard, but not the double dose. D-ss-hydroxybutyrate /M in doses previously shown to be associated with improved survival is safe in a porcine hemorrhagic shock/polytrauma model.

After 3 days on chow or HE diet, DR and DIO rats were assessed for their ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) ketone bodies levels and neuronal ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) sensing using microdialysis coupled to continuous food intake monitoring and calcium imaging in dissociated neurons, respectively. DIO rats ate more than DR rats over 3 days of HE diet intake. On day 3 of HE diet intake, DR rats reduced their caloric intake while DIO rats remained hyperphagic. Local VMH astrocyte ketone bodies production was similar between DR and DIO rats during the first 6 h after dark onset feeding but inhibiting VMH ketone body production in DR rats on day 3 transiently returned their intake of HE diet to the level of DIO rats consuming HE diet. In addition, dissociated VMN neurons from DIO and DR rats were equally sensitive to the largely excitatory effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Thus while DR rats respond to increased VMH ketone levels by decreasing their intake after 3 days of HE diet, this is not the case of DIO rats. These data suggest that DIO inherent leptin resistance prevents ketone bodies inhibitory action on food intake.",0,primary hepatocytes from fed mice; primary hepatocytes from fasted mice,animal; in vitro,Multi-model,"intracellular NADH, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,liver,Liver,hepatocytes,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"alanine-stimulated gluconeogenesis, up","Gluconeogenesis, up",beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB)/acetoacetate (Acoc),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

However, the pathogenic contribution of these changes and whether they modulate normal tissue function is unclear. As alterations in hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogen metabolism are hallmarks that characterize insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, we tested whether imposed changes in the extracellular redox state could modulate these processes. Thus, primary hepatocytes were treated with different ratios of the following physiological extracellular redox couples: beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB)/acetoacetate (Acoc), reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and cysteine/cystine. Exposure to a more oxidized ratio via extracellular betaOHB/Acoc, GSH/GSSG, and cysteine/cystine in hepatocytes from fed mice increased intracellular hydrogen peroxide without causing oxidative damage. On the other hand, addition of more reduced ratios of extracellular betaOHB/Acoc led to increased NAD(P)H and maximal mitochondrial respiratory capacity in hepatocytes. Greater betaOHB/Acoc ratios were also associated with decreased beta-oxidation, as expected with enhanced lipogenesis. In hepatocytes from fasted mice, a more extracellular reduced state of betaOHB/Acoc led to increased alanine-stimulated gluconeogenesis and enhanced glycogen synthesis capacity from added glucose. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that the extracellular redox state regulates the major metabolic functions of the liver and involves changes in intracellular NADH, hydrogen peroxide, and mitochondrial respiration. Because redox state in the blood can be communicated to all metabolically sensitive tissues, this work confirms the hypothesis that circulating redox state may be an important regulator of whole body metabolism and contribute to alterations associated with metabolic diseases.",GFAP,adult rats; continuous lumbar spinal cord AMPA infusion,animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Other Mammal,"mitochondrial energy metabolism, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,lumbar spinal cord,Spinal cord,motor neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,Neurodegenerative,"motor deficits and paralysis, down","Motor function, down",co-infusion,NS,NS
25991463,Degeneration of spinal motor neurons by chronic AMPA-induced excitotoxicity in vivo and protection by energy substrates.,"INTRODUCTION: Several data suggest that excitotoxicity due to excessive glutamatergic neurotransmission may be an important factor in the mechanisms of motor neuron (MN) death occurring in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We have previously shown that the overactivation of the Ca(2+)-permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) glutamate receptor type, through the continuous infusion of AMPA in the lumbar spinal cord of adult rats during several days, results in progressive rear limb paralysis and bilateral MN degeneration. Because it has been shown that energy failure and oxidative stress are involved in MN degeneration, in both ALS and experimental models of spinal MN degeneration, including excitotoxicity, in this work we tested the protective effect of the energy substrates pyruvate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) and the antioxidants glutathione ethyl ester (GEE) and ascorbate in this chronic AMPA-induced neurodegeneration. RESULTS: AMPA infusion induced remarkable progressive motor deficits, assessed by two motor tasks, that by day seven reach bilateral rear limb paralysis. These effects correlate with the death of >80% of lumbar spinal MNs in the infused and the neighbor spinal cord segments, as well as with notable astrogliosis in the ventral horns, detected by glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry. Co-infusion with pyruvate or betaHB notably prevented the motor deficits and paralysis, decreased MN loss to <25% and completely prevented the induction of astrogliosis. In contrast, the antioxidants tested were ineffective regarding all parameters analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic progressive excitotoxicity due to AMPA receptors overactivation results in MN death and astrogliosis, with consequent motor deficits and paralysis. Because of the notable protection against these effects exerted by pyruvate and betaHB, which are well established mitochondrial energy substrates, we conclude that deficits in mitochondrial energy metabolism are an important factor in the mechanisms of this slowly developed excitotoxic MN death, while the lack of protective effect of the antioxidants indicates that oxidative stress seems to be less significant factor. Because excitotoxicity may be involved in MN degeneration in ALS, these findings suggest possible preventive or therapeutic strategies for the disease.",NLRP3,NS,NS,NS,"Nlrp3 inflammasome inhibition, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,NS,NS,myeloid cells,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Autoinflammatory diseases,Autoimmune & Inflammatory,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

Growing evidence indicates that ketone bodies have beneficial effects in treating stroke, but their underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study showed ketone bodies reduced reactive oxygen species by using NADH as an electron donor, thus increasing the NAD(+)/NADH ratio. In this study, we investigated whether mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) could mediate the neuroprotective effects of ketone bodies after ischemic stroke. We injected mice with either normal saline or ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) at 30 minutes after ischemia induced by transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. We found that ketone treatment enhanced mitochondria function, reduced oxidative stress, and therefore reduced infarct volume. This led to improved neurologic function after ischemia, including the neurologic score and the performance in Rotarod and open field tests. We further showed that ketones' effects were achieved by upregulating NAD(+)-dependent SIRT3 and its downstream substrates forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) in the penumbra region since knocking down SIRT3 in vitro diminished ketones' beneficial effects.

26286937,Ketone Body Therapy Protects From Lipotoxicity and Acute Liver Failure Upon Pparalpha Deficiency.,"Acute liver failure (ALF) is a severe and rapid liver injury, often occurring without any preexisting liver disease, which may precipitate multiorgan failure and death. ALF is often associated with impaired beta-oxidation and increased oxidative stress (OS), characterized by elevated levels of hepatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) products. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha has been shown to confer hepatoprotection in acute and chronic liver injury, at least in part, related to its ability to control peroxisomal and mitochondrial beta-oxidation. To study the pathophysiological role of PPARalpha in hepatic response to high OS, we induced a pronounced LPO by treating wild-type and Pparalpha-deficient mice with high doses of fish oil (FO), containing n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. FO feeding of Pparalpha-deficient mice, in contrast to control sunflower oil, surprisingly induced coma and death due to ALF as indicated by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, ammonia, and a liver-specific increase of ROS and LPO-derived malondialdehyde. Reconstitution of PPARalpha specifically in the liver using adeno-associated serotype 8 virus-PPARalpha in Pparalpha-deficient mice restored beta-oxidation and ketogenesis and protected mice from FO-induced lipotoxicity and death. Interestingly, administration of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate prevented FO-induced ALF in Pparalpha-deficient mice, and normalized liver ROS and malondialdehyde levels. Therefore, PPARalpha protects the liver from FO-induced OS through its regulatory actions on ketone body levels. beta-Hydroxybutyrate treatment could thus be an option to prevent LPO-induced liver damage.",FXN,primary FRDA fibroblasts,in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"cell growth/viability, down","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",NS,NS,primary FRDA fibroblasts,Stromal / Mesenchymal,Fibroblasts,mitochondrial matrix,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Friedreich ataxia,Genetic / Congenital,"cell growth/viability, down","Cell viability, down",in media with beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as carbon source,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

ISCs are prosthetic groups critical for the function of the Krebs cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Decreased expression of frataxin is associated with decreased ISC assembly, mitochondrial iron accumulation, and increased oxidative stress, all of which contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. In media with beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as carbon source, primary FRDA fibroblasts grow poorly and/or lose viability over several days. We screened a random, short-hairpin-RNA (shRNA)-expressing library in primary FRDA fibroblasts and identified two shRNAs that reverse the growth/viability defect in BHB media.

In the present study we have investigated whether protection by the D isomer of BHB (D-BHB) against neuronal death induced by glucose deprivation (GD), is related to autophagy. Autophagy is a lysosomal-dependent degradation process activated during nutritional stress, which leads to the digestion of damaged proteins and organelles providing energy for cell survival. Results show that autophagy is activated in cortical cultured neurons during GD, as indicated by the increase in the levels of the lipidated form of the microtubule associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-II), and the number of autophagic vesicles. At early phases of glucose reintroduction (GR), the levels of p62 declined suggesting that the degradation of the autophagolysosomal content takes place at this time. In cultures exposed to GD and GR in the presence of D-BHB, the levels of LC3-II and p62 rapidly declined and remained low during GR, suggesting that the KB stimulates the autophagic flux preventing autophagosome accumulation and improving neuronal survival.",0,betamethasone-exposed rat offspring; NMDA-triggered spasms model,animal,Animal – Rat,"acute stabilization of brain metabolites, up",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Infantile spasms,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"latency to onset of spasms, up (delayed); number of spasms, down; interactions with strangers, down; contextual memory, up","Seizure activity, up (delayed); Seizure activity, down; Social interaction, down; Memory (general), up",i.p.

The ketogenic diet (KD) has been successfully used as a treatment for IS. This study was designed to test whether beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a major metabolite of the KD, is effective in an animal model of IS. METHODS: Pregnant rats received betamethasone on gestational day 15. The offspring received either single [30min prior to NMDA-triggered spasms on postnatal day (P) 15] or prolonged (three per day from P12 to P15) i.p. BHB. An additional experiment used repeated bouts of spasms on P12, P13, and P15 with randomized prolonged BHB treatment initiated after the first spasms. We determined the latency to onset of spasms and the number of spasms after the NMDA injection on P15. The rats that received randomized BHB treatment were also monitored with open field, sociability, and fear-conditioning tests and underwent in vivo (1)H MR imaging on a 9.4T MR system after NMDA-induced spasms. The acquired (1)H MR spectra were quantified using LC model. RESULTS: Single-dose BHB pretreatment had no effect on spasms. In contrast, prolonged pretreatment with BHB significantly delayed the onset and decreased the frequency of spasms. In addition, randomized prolonged BHB treatment resulted in a significant reduction in number of spasms at P15. BHB treatment had no significant effect on motor activities, but significantly decreased the interactions with strangers and increased the contextual memory. On MR spectroscopic analysis of randomized prolonged BHB-treated rats at 24h after the cluster of spasms, the elevation of GABA, glutamine, glutamate, total creatine, macromolecule-plus lipids, and N-acetylaspartate levels after spasms were significantly attenuated by randomized BHB treatment (p<0.05).

26498829,BACE1 activity impairs neuronal glucose oxidation: rescue by beta-hydroxybutyrate and lipoic acid.,"Glucose hypometabolism and impaired mitochondrial function in neurons have been suggested to play early and perhaps causative roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Activity of the aspartic acid protease, beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), responsible for beta amyloid peptide generation, has recently been demonstrated to modify glucose metabolism. We therefore examined, using a human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell line, whether increased BACE1 activity is responsible for a reduction in cellular glucose metabolism. Overexpression of active BACE1, but not a protease-dead mutant BACE1, protein in SH-SY5Y cells reduced glucose oxidation and the basal oxygen consumption rate, which was associated with a compensatory increase in glycolysis. Increased BACE1 activity had no effect on the mitochondrial electron transfer process but was found to diminish substrate delivery to the mitochondria by inhibition of key mitochondrial decarboxylation reaction enzymes. This BACE1 activity-dependent deficit in glucose oxidation was alleviated by the presence of beta hydroxybutyrate or alpha-lipoic acid. Consequently our data indicate that raised cellular BACE1 activity drives reduced glucose oxidation in a human neuronal cell line through impairments in the activity of specific tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. Because this bioenergetic deficit is recoverable by neutraceutical compounds we suggest that such agents, perhaps in conjunction with BACE1 inhibitors, may be an effective therapeutic strategy in the early-stage management or treatment of AD.",0; LDLR; SREBF2,rats; healthy humans,animal; human,Animal – Rat; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"ketosis, up",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",betaHB ester (KE) ((R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate),Ketone ester (KE),D-BHB

Neither betaHB nor AcAc are well utilized for synthesis of sterols or fatty acids in human or rat liver. To study the effects of ketones on cholesterol homeostasis a novel betaHB ester (KE) ((R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate) was synthesized and given orally to rats and humans as a partial dietary carbohydrate replacement. Rats maintained on a diet containing 30-energy % as KE with a concomitant reduction in carbohydrate had lower plasma cholesterol and mevalonate (-40 and -27 %, respectively) and in the liver had lower levels of the mevalonate precursors acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA (-33 and -54 %) compared to controls. Whole liver and membrane LDL-R as well as SREBP-2 protein levels were higher (+24, +67, and +91 %, respectively). When formulated into a beverage for human consumption subjects consuming a KE drink (30-energy %) had elevated plasma betaHB which correlated with decreased mevalonate, a liver cholesterol synthesis biomarker. Partial replacement of dietary carbohydrate with KE induced ketosis and altered cholesterol homeostasis in rats. In healthy individuals an elevated plasma betaHB correlated with lower plasma mevalonate.",OCLN; AQP4; SLC2A1; NFKB1,rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"BBB integrity, down",Vascular Function & Angiogenesis,cerebral cortex,Brain/CNS,brain capillary endothelial cells,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Traumatic brain injury,Injury & Trauma,"BBB permeability, no-change","BBB integrity, no-change",NS,NS,NS

Evans blue (EB) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used as determinants of BBB permeability. Glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were estimated in the right (injury side) cerebral cortex of animals. The gene expression levels for occludin, glucose transporter (Glut)-1, aquaporin4 (AQP4) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were performed, and Glut-1 and NF-kappaB activities were analyzed. BHB treatment decreased GSH and MDA levels in intact animals and in those exposed to TBI (P<0.05). Glut-1 protein levels decreased in sham, BHB and TBI plus BHB groups (P<0.05). NF-kappaB protein levels increased in animals treated with BHB and/or exposed to TBI (P<0.05). The expression levels of occludin and AQP4 did not significantly change among experimental groups. Glut-1 expression levels increased in BHB treated and untreated animals exposed to TBI (P<0.05). While NF-kappaB expression levels increased in animals in TBI (P<0.01), a decrease was noticed in these animals upon BHB treatment (P<0.01). In animals exposed to TBI, EB extravasation was observed in the ipsilateral cortex regardless of BHB treatment. Ultrastructurally, BHB attenuated but did not prevent the presence of HRP in brain capillary endothelial cells of animals with TBI; moreover, the drug also led to the observation of the tracer when used in intact rats (P<0.01). Altogether, these results showed that BHB not only failed to provide overall protective effects on BBB in TBI but also led to BBB disruption in healthy animals.",0,rat brain synaptosomes; cortical neurons,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; NS,"reduction of endocytosis, down",Other / Unspecified,brain,Brain/CNS,presynaptic terminals,Neural / Glial,Neurons,synaptic vesicles,Secretory Vesicles & Trafficking,Synaptic vesicles,nan,Other / Unspecified,"anticonvulsant activity, NS","Seizure protection, NS",as the main energy substrate,NS,NS
26838474,beta-Hydroxybutyrate supports synaptic vesicle cycling but reduces endocytosis and exocytosis in rat brain synaptosomes.,"The ketogenic diet is used as a prophylactic treatment for different types of brain diseases, such as epilepsy or Alzheimer's disease. In such a diet, carbohydrates are replaced by fats in everyday food, resulting in an elevation of blood-borne ketone bodies levels. Despite clinical applications of this treatment, the molecular mechanisms by which the ketogenic diet exerts its beneficial effects are still uncertain. In this study, we investigated the effect of replacing glucose by the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate as the main energy substrate on synaptic vesicle recycling in rat brain synaptosomes. First, we observed that exposing presynaptic terminals to nonglycolytic energy substrates instead of glucose did not alter the plasma membrane potential. Next, we found that synaptosomes were able to maintain the synaptic vesicle cycle monitored with the fluorescent dye acridine orange when glucose was replaced by beta-hydroxybutyrate. However, in presence of beta-hydroxybutyrate, synaptic vesicle recycling was modified with reduced endocytosis. Replacing glucose by pyruvate also led to a reduced endocytosis. Addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate to glucose-containing incubation medium was without effect. Reduced endocytosis in presence of beta-hydroxybutyrate as sole energy substrate was confirmed using the fluorescent dye FM2-10. Also we found that replacement of glucose by ketone bodies leads to inhibition of exocytosis, monitored by FM2-10. However this reduction was smaller than the effect on endocytosis under the same conditions. Using both acridine orange in synaptosomes and the genetically encoded sensor synaptopHluorin in cortical neurons, we observed that replacing glucose by beta-hydroxybutyrate did not modify the pH gradient of synaptic vesicles. In conclusion, the nonglycolytic energy substrates beta-hydroxybutyrate and pyruvate are able to support synaptic vesicle recycling. However, they both reduce endocytosis. Reduction of both endocytosis and exocytosis together with misbalance between endocytosis and exocytosis could be involved in the anticonvulsant activity of the ketogenic diet.",PER2,mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"beta-hydroxybutyrate production, NS",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"food anticipation, up","Appetite, up",liver-derived,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

As daily food anticipation (FA) is independent of the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the central pacemaker of the circadian system, questions arise of where FA signals originate and what role components of the circadian clock might play. Here we show that liver-specific deletion of Per2 in mice abolishes FA, an effect that is rescued by viral overexpression of Per2 in the liver. RNA sequencing indicates that Per2 regulates beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) production to induce FA leading to the conclusion that liver Per2 is important for this process. Unexpectedly, we show that FA originates in the liver and not in the brain. However, manifestation of FA involves processing of the liver-derived betaOHB signal in the brain, indicating that the food-entrainable oscillator is not located in a single tissue but is of systemic nature.",0; AKT1,rats; lithium-pilocarpine seizure model,animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Other Mammal,"HDAC activity, down",Epigenetic Regulation,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"seizure severity, down","Seizure severity, down",endogenous,NS,NS

The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether time-restricted feeding (TRF) has an anticonvulsant effect and whether this restrictive diet promotes changes in energy metabolism and epigenetic modifications in a pilocarpine-induced seizure model. To resolve our hypothesis, one group of rats had free access to food and water ad libitum (AL) and a second group underwent a TRF schedule. We used the lithium-pilocarpine model to induce status epilepticus (SE), and behavioral seizure monitoring was analyzed. Additionally, an electroencephalography (EEG) recording was performed to verify the effect of TRF on cortical electrical activity after a pilocarpine injection. For biochemical analysis, animals were sacrificed 24 h after SE and hippocampal homogenates were used to evaluate the proteins related to metabolism and chromatin structure. Our results showed that TRF had an anticonvulsant effect as measured by the prolonged latency of forelimb clonus seizure, a decrease in the seizure severity score and fewer animals reaching SE. Additionally, the power of the late phase EEG recordings in the AL group was significantly higher than the TRF group. Moreover, we found that TRF is capable of inducing alterations in signaling pathways that regulate energy metabolism, including an increase in the phosphorylation of AMP dependent kinase (AMPK) and a decrease in the phosphorylation of Akt kinase. Furthermore, we found that TRF was able to significantly increase the beta hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) concentration, an endogenous inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Finally, we found a significant decrease in HDAC activity as well as an increase in acetylation on histone 3 (H3) in hippocampal homogenates from the TRF group. These findings suggest that alterations in energy metabolism and the increase in beta-HB mediated by TRF may inhibit HDAC activity, thus increasing histone acetylation and producing changes in the chromatin structure, which likely facilitates the transcription of a subset of genes that confer anticonvulsant activity.",0,rat model of dry eye disease; 65 patients with dry eye disease,human; animal,Animal – Rat; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,ocular surface,Eye/Retina,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Dry eye disease,Ophthalmologic,"corneal rose Bengal score, improved; corneal fluorescein staining score, improved (in Schirmer ≤5 mm subgroup at 2 weeks)","Corneal staining score, improved; Corneal staining, improved (in Schirmer ≤5 mm subgroup at 2 weeks)",1% D-3-hydroxybutyrate eye drops,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

In the current investigation, we performed a prospective, randomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of 1% D-3-hydroxybutyrate eye drops in patients with dry eye disease. A total of 65 patients were randomly assigned to either the placebo group or the 1% D-3-hydroxybutyrate group, and the treatments were administered 6 times a day for 4 weeks. We then evaluated corneal fluorescein staining, corneal and conjunctival rose Bengal staining, tear film break-up time (BUT), Schirmer score, and subjective symptoms. At both 2 and 4 weeks, the corneal rose Bengal score was significantly better in the 1% D-3-hydroxybutyrate group than in the placebo group. Among patients with an initial Schirmer score of </=5 mm, the corneal fluorescein staining score was significantly better in the 1% D-3-hydroxybutyrate group than in the placebo group at two weeks.

As traditional mitochondrial energy substrates, ketone bodies (ketones, for short), beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate, have been reported to provide symptomatic improvement and disease-modifying activity in epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, ketones are thought as more than just metabolites and also as endogenous factors protecting against AD. In this study, we discovered a novel neuroprotective mechanism of ketones in which they blocked amyloid-beta 42, a pathologic hallmark protein of AD, entry into neurons. The suppression of intracellular amyloid-beta 42 accumulation rescued mitochondrial complex I activity, reduced oxidative stress, and improved synaptic plasticity. Most importantly, we show that peripheral administration of ketones significantly reduced amyloid burden and greatly improved learning and memory ability in a symptomatic mouse model of AD. These observations provide us insights to understand and to establish a novel therapeutic use of ketones in AD prevention.",0,Pgc1alpha(-/-) mice; iNephPGC1alpha transgenic mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"prostaglandin PGE2 production, up",Inflammation & Immune Response,kidney,Kidney,tubular epithelial cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Acute kidney injury,Renal & Urological,"renal function, up","Kidney function, up",fat breakdown product,NS,NS
27018251,PGC1alpha drives NAD biosynthesis linking oxidative metabolism to renal protection.,"The energetic burden of continuously concentrating solutes against gradients along the tubule may render the kidney especially vulnerable to ischaemia. Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects 3% of all hospitalized patients. Here we show that the mitochondrial biogenesis regulator, PGC1alpha, is a pivotal determinant of renal recovery from injury by regulating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis. Following renal ischaemia, Pgc1alpha(-/-) (also known as Ppargc1a(-/-)) mice develop local deficiency of the NAD precursor niacinamide (NAM, also known as nicotinamide), marked fat accumulation, and failure to re-establish normal function. Notably, exogenous NAM improves local NAD levels, fat accumulation, and renal function in post-ischaemic Pgc1alpha(-/-) mice. Inducible tubular transgenic mice (iNephPGC1alpha) recapitulate the effects of NAM supplementation, including more local NAD and less fat accumulation with better renal function after ischaemia. PGC1alpha coordinately upregulates the enzymes that synthesize NAD de novo from amino acids whereas PGC1alpha deficiency or AKI attenuates the de novo pathway. NAM enhances NAD via the enzyme NAMPT and augments production of the fat breakdown product beta-hydroxybutyrate, leading to increased production of prostaglandin PGE2 (ref. 5), a secreted autacoid that maintains renal function. NAM treatment reverses established ischaemic AKI and also prevented AKI in an unrelated toxic model. Inhibition of beta-hydroxybutyrate signalling or prostaglandin production similarly abolishes PGC1alpha-dependent renoprotection. Given the importance of mitochondrial health in ageing and the function of metabolically active organs, the results implicate NAM and NAD as key effectors for achieving PGC1alpha-dependent stress resistance.",ALPL; 0,MC3T3-E1 cells; primary mouse osteoblasts,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line; Multi-model,"control of alkaline phosphatase activity, down",Metabolic Regulation,bone,Bone,osteoblasts,Bone & Cartilage,Osteoblasts,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

While insulin depletion increases the blood concentration of ketone bodies, i.e., acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, their roles in bone metabolism have not been much studied until today. We investigated the effects of acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate on mineralization of extracellular matrix in cultures of mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and primary mouse osteoblasts in the presence and absence of bone morphogenetic protein-2. Acetoacetate potentiated alkaline phosphatase activity in MC3T3-E1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, ranging from physiological to pathological concentrations (0.05-5 mmol/L). In contrast, beta-hydroxybutyrate lowered it in the same experimental settings. Mineralization in cultures of these cells was also up-regulated by acetoacetate and down-regulated by beta-hydroxybutyrate. Similar results were obtained in cultures of mouse primary osteoblasts. Neither alkaline phosphatase mRNA nor its protein expression in MC3T3-E1 cells was affected by acetoacetate or beta-hydroxybutyrate, indicating that these ketone bodies control the enzyme activity of alkaline phosphatase in osteoblasts and hence their mineralization bi-directionally. Finally, either gene silencing of monocarboxylate transporter-1, a major transmembrate transporter for ketone bodies, nullified the effects of ketone bodies on alkaline phosphatase activity in MC3T3-E1 cells. Collectively, we found that ketone bodies bidirectionally modulates osteoblast functions, which suggests that ketone bodies are important endogenous factors that regulate bone metabolism in both physiological and pathological situations.",0,R6/2 mice; littermate controls,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; NS,"inhibitory synaptic transmission, down",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,brain,Brain/CNS,striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs),Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Huntington's disease,Neurodegenerative,"weight loss, down; open field performance, up; stereotypies, down","Body weight, down; Locomotor activity, up; Stereotypic behavior, down",ketogenic diet (KD); addition of BHB,Ketogenic diet (endogenous); NS,NS
27073901,Partial Amelioration of Peripheral and Central Symptoms of Huntington's Disease via Modulation of Lipid Metabolism.,"BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by uncontrollable dance-like movements, as well as cognitive deficits and mood changes. A feature of HD is a metabolic disturbance that precedes neurological symptoms. In addition, brain cholesterol synthesis is significantly reduced, which could hamper synaptic transmission. OBJECTIVE: Alterations in lipid metabolism as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in the R6/2 mouse model of HD were examined. METHODS: Electrophysiological recordings in vitro examined the acute effects of cholesterol-modifying drugs. In addition, behavioral testing, effects on synaptic activity, and measurements of circulating and brain tissue concentrations of cholesterol and the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), were examined in symptomatic R6/2 mice and littermate controls raised on normal chow or a ketogenic diet (KD). RESULTS: Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) from symptomatic R6/2 mice showed increased frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) compared with littermate controls. Incubation of slices in cholesterol reduced the frequency of large-amplitude sIPSCs. Addition of BHB or the Liver X Receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317 reduced the frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs. Surprisingly, incubation in simvastatin to reduce cholesterol levels also decreased the frequency of sIPSCs. HD mice fed the KD lost weight more gradually, performed better in an open field, had fewer stereotypies and lower brain levels of cholesterol than mice fed a regular diet. CONCLUSIONS: Lipid metabolism represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention in HD. Modifying cholesterol or ketone levels acutely in the brain can partially rescue synaptic alterations, and the KD can prevent weight loss and improve some behavioral abnormalities.",INS; 0,Sprague-Dawley rats; streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"oxidative stress, down",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Metabolic & Endocrine,"ketoacidosis, down","Ketoacidosis, down",NS,NS,NS

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of naringin on glucose intolerance, oxidative stress and ketonemia in type 1 diabetic rats. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats divided into 5 groups (n = 7) were orally treated daily with 3.0 ml/kg body weight (BW)/day of distilled water (group 1) or 50 mg/kg BW of naringin (groups 2 and 4, respectively). Groups 3, 4 and 5 were given a single intra-peritoneal injection of 60 mg/kg BW of streptozotocin to induce diabetes. Group 3 was further treated with subcutaneous insulin (4.0 IU/kg BW) twice daily, respectively. RESULTS: Stretozotocin (STZ) only-treated groups exhibited hyperglycemia, polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, glucose intolerance, low fasting plasma insulin and reduced hepatic glycogen content compared to the control group. Furthermore they had significantly elevated Malondialdehyde (MDA), acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, anion gap and significantly reduced blood pH and plasma bicarbonate compared to the control group. Naringin treatment significantly improved Fasting Plasma Insulin (FPI), hepatic glycogen content, malondialdehyde, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, bicarbonate, blood pH and anion gap but not Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG) compared to the STZ only-treated group.

Histone Kbhb marks are dramatically induced in response to elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate levels in cultured cells and in livers from mice subjected to prolonged fasting or streptozotocin-induced diabetic ketoacidosis. In total, we identified 44 histone Kbhb sites, a figure comparable to the known number of histone acetylation sites. By ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis, we demonstrate that histone Kbhb is a mark enriched in active gene promoters and that the increased H3K9bhb levels that occur during starvation are associated with genes upregulated in starvation-responsive metabolic pathways. Histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation thus represents a new epigenetic regulatory mark that couples metabolism to gene expression, offering a new avenue to study chromatin regulation and diverse functions of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the context of important human pathophysiological states, including diabetes, epilepsy, and neoplasia.",HSPA5; 0; TF,mice; endothelial cells; R. oryzae,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells; Animal – Other Mammal,"BHB-related acidosis, up",Metabolic Regulation,endothelium,Vasculature,endothelial cells,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Mucormycosis,Infectious,"susceptibility to mucormycosis, up","Susceptibility to mucormycosis, up",beta-hydroxy butyrate (BHB),NS,NS

Previously, we demonstrated that Rhizopus invades the endothelium via binding of fungal CotH proteins to the host receptor GRP78. Here, we report that surface expression of GRP78 is increased in endothelial cells exposed to physiological concentrations of beta-hydroxy butyrate (BHB), glucose, and iron that are similar to those found in DKA patients. Additionally, expression of R. oryzae CotH was increased within hours of incubation with DKA-associated concentrations of BHB, glucose, and iron, augmenting the ability of R. oryzae to invade and subsequently damage endothelial cells in vitro. BHB exposure also increased fungal growth and attenuated R. oryzae neutrophil-mediated damage. Further, mice given BHB developed clinical acidosis and became extremely susceptible to mucormycosis, but not aspergillosis, while sodium bicarbonate reversed this susceptibility. BHB-related acidosis exerted a direct effect on both GRP78 and CotH expression, an effect not seen with lactic acidosis. However, BHB also indirectly compromised the ability of transferrin to chelate iron, as iron chelation combined with sodium bicarbonate completely protected endothelial cells from Rhizopus-mediated invasion and damage.

27253067,beta-Hydroxybutyrate elevation as a compensatory response against oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes.,"Recent studies have shown that the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) acts not only as a carrier of energy but also as a signaling molecule that has a role in diverse cellular functions. Circulating levels of ketone bodies have been previously reported to be increased in patients with congestive heart failure (HF). In this study, we investigated regulatory mechanism and pathophysiological role of betaOHB in HF. First, we revealed that betaOHB level was elevated in failing hearts, but not in blood, using pressure-overloaded mice. We also measured cellular betaOHB levels in both cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes stimulated with or without H2O2 and revealed that increased myocardial betaOHB was derived from cardiomyocytes but not non-cardiomyocytes under pathological states. Next, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms of myocardial betaOHB elevation and its implication under pathological states. The gene and protein expression levels of CoA transferase (SCOT), a key enzyme involved in ketone body oxidation, was decreased in failing hearts. In cardiomyocytes, H2O2 stimulation caused betaOHB accumulation concomitantly with SCOT downregulation, implying that the accumulation of myocardial betaOHB occurs because of the decline in its utilization. Finally, we checked the effects of betaOHB on cardiomyocytes under oxidative stress. We found that betaOHB induced FOXO3a, an oxidative stress resistance gene, and its target enzyme, SOD2 and catalase. Consequently, betaOHB attenuated reactive oxygen species production and alleviated apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. It has been reported that hyperadrenergic state in HF boost lipolysis and result in elevation of circulating free fatty acids, which can lead hepatic ketogenesis for energy metabolism alteration. The present findings suggest that the accumulation of betaOHB also occurs as a compensatory response against oxidative stress in failing hearts.",BDNF,Mus musculus,animal,Animal – Mouse,"Bdnf promoter induction, up",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",endogenous (released after exercise); direct ventricular application,NS; Intravenous BHB,NS

However, the exact mechanisms whereby physical exercise produces an induction in brain Bdnf gene expression are not well understood. While pharmacological doses of HDAC inhibitors exert positive effects on Bdnf gene transcription, the inhibitors represent small molecules that do not occur in vivo. Here, we report that an endogenous molecule released after exercise is capable of inducing key promoters of the Mus musculus Bdnf gene. The metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate, which increases after prolonged exercise, induces the activities of Bdnf promoters, particularly promoter I, which is activity-dependent. We have discovered that the action of beta-hydroxybutyrate is specifically upon HDAC2 and HDAC3, which act upon selective Bdnf promoters. Moreover, the effects upon hippocampal Bdnf expression were observed after direct ventricular application of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that beta-hydroxybutyrate causes an increase in neurotransmitter release, which is dependent upon the TrkB receptor. These results reveal an endogenous mechanism to explain how physical exercise leads to the induction of BDNF.",HDAC3,fetal liver; neonatal liver,animal,Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"HDAC3 inhibition, down",Epigenetic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

However, it is unclear how this critical trait is acquired and regulated. We demonstrate that under the control of PPARalpha, the genes required for lipid catabolism are transcribed before birth so that the neonatal liver has a prompt capacity to extract energy from milk upon suckling. The mechanism involves a fetal glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-PPARalpha axis in which GR directly regulates the transcriptional activation of PPARalpha by binding to its promoter. Certain PPARalpha target genes such as Fgf21 remain repressed in the fetal liver and become PPARalpha responsive after birth following an epigenetic switch triggered by beta-hydroxybutyrate-mediated inhibition of HDAC3. This study identifies an endocrine developmental axis in which fetal GR primes the activity of PPARalpha in anticipation of the sudden shifts in postnatal nutrient source and metabolic demands.",0,19 non-demented elderly adults (mean age 66.1 +/- 2.9 years),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"ketone body elevation, up",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"working memory, up; visual attention, up; task switching, up","Memory (general), up; Cognition, up; Cognitive performance, up",ketogenic meal (Ketonformula(R)) containing 20 g of MCTs,MCT / Medium-chain fats,NS

OBJECTIVES: We tried to examine the possible effects of a ketogenic meal serving on cognition in elderly non-demented subjects. METHODS: Subjects were 19 non-demented elderly adults over 60 years old (13 females; mean age: 66.1 +/- 2.9 years) who underwent neurocognitive tests 90 and 180 min after oral intake of a ketogenic meal (Ketonformula(R)) containing 20 g of MCTs and an isocaloric placebo meal without MCTs on separate days. RESULTS: Elevation of plasma ketone concentration after intake of a single ketogenic meal containing 20 g of MCTs was confirmed (all p < 0.001). As for cognition, improvements were observed in the digit span test, Trail-Making Test B, and the global score (Z = -2.4, p = 0.017) following the ketogenic meal and the change in the executive functioning score was positively correlated with that of the plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate level. The cognition-enhancing effect was observed predominantly for individuals who had a relatively low global score at baseline (Z = -2.8, p = 0.005), compared to individuals with a high global score (Z = -0.7, p = 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma levels of ketone bodies were successfully increased after intake of the ketogenic meal. The ketogenic meal was suggested to have positive effects on working memory, visual attention, and task switching in non-demented elderly.",EIF2AK3; ERN1; ATF6; PYCARD; CASP1; NLRP3; SOD2; CAT,Sprague Dawley rats (6 and 24 months); HepG2 cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"AMP-activated protein kinase-forkhead box protein O3alpha pathway, NS",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,HepG2 cells,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,endoplasmic reticulum,Endoplasmic Reticulum,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"inflammasome formation, down","Inflammation, down","200 mg.kg-1.d-1 i.p., for 5 d; starvation-induced increased serum beta-hydroxybutyrate",Intraperitoneal BHB; Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
27741233,beta-Hydroxybutyrate suppresses inflammasome formation by ameliorating endoplasmic reticulum stress via AMPK activation.,"beta-Hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body that is used as an energy source in organs such as the brain, muscle, and heart when blood glucose is low, is produced by fatty acid oxidation in the liver under the fasting state. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is linked with the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the accumulation of misfolded protein in the ER. ER stress is known to induce the NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, which mediates activation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta, whose maturation is caspase-1-dependent. We investigated whether beta-hydroxybutyrate modulates ER stress, inflammasome formation, and insulin signaling. Sprague Dawley rats (6 and 24 months of age) that were starved for 3 d and rats treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate (200 mg.kg-1.d-1 i.p., for 5 d) were used for in vivo investigations, whereas human hepatoma HepG2 cells were used for in vitro studies. Overexpression of AMPK in cultured cells was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism. The starvation resulted in increased serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels with decreased ER stress (PERK, IRE1, and ATF6alpha) and inflammasome (ASC, caspase-1, and NLRP3) formation compared with non-fasted 24-month-old rats. In addition, beta-hydroxybutyrate suppressed the increase of ER stress- and inflammasome-related marker proteins. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment increased the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase via the AMP-activated protein kinase-forkhead box protein O3alpha transcription factor pathway both in vivo and in vitro. The significance of the current study was the discovery of the potential therapeutic role of beta-hydroxybutyrate in suppressing ER-stress-induced inflammasome formation.",0,differentiated human preadipocytes,human; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"proton leak, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,adipocytes,Adipose tissue,differentiated human preadipocytes,Adipose,Preadipocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
27935189,"Extracellular Redox Regulation of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Generation, Mitochondrial Function and Lipid Turnover in Cultured Human Adipocytes.","BACKGROUND: Many tissues play an important role in metabolic homeostasis and the development of diabetes and obesity. We hypothesized that the circulating redox metabolome is a master metabolic regulatory system that impacts all organs and modulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation, energy production and changes in lipid turnover in many cells including adipocytes. METHODS: Differentiated human preadipocytes were exposed to the redox couples, lactate (L) and pyruvate (P), beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) and acetoacetate (Acoc), and the thiol-disulfides cysteine/ cystine (Cys/CySS) and GSH/GSSG for 1.5-4 hours. ROS measurements were done with CM-H2DCFDA. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) was assessed by a modification of the thiobarbituric acid method. Lipolysis was measured as glycerol release. Lipid synthesis was measured as 14C-glucose incorporated into lipid. Respiration was assessed using the SeaHorse XF24 analyzer and the proton leak was determined from the difference in respiration with oligomycin and antimycin A. RESULTS: Metabolites with increasing oxidation potentials (GSSG, CySS, Acoc) increased adipocyte ROS. In contrast, P caused a decrease in ROS compared with L. Acoc also induced a significant increase in both LPO and lipid synthesis. L and Acoc increased lipolysis. betaOHB increased respiration, mainly due to an increased proton leak. GSSG, when present throughout 14 days of differentiation significantly increased fat accumulation, but not when added later. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that in human adipocytes changes in the external redox state impacted ROS production, LPO, energy efficiency, lipid handling, and differentiation. A more oxidized state generally led to increased ROS, LPO and lipid turnover and more reduction led to increased respiration and a proton leak. However, not all of the redox couples were the same suggesting compartmentalization. These data are consistent with the concept of the circulating redox metabolome as a master metabolic regulatory system.",SLC2A1; 0,mice; brain microvascular endothelial cells; NB2a neuronal cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"histone acetylation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,brain microvascular endothelial cells,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",fasting-induced production,Fasting / Caloric restriction (endogenous),NS

Those metabolome data showed that hepatic glucose content is reduced, but that brain glucose content is unaffected, during fasting, consistent with the priority given to brain glucose consumption during fasting. The molecular mechanisms for this preferential glucose supply to the brain are not fully understood. We also showed that the fasting-induced production of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) enhances expression of the glucose transporter gene Slc2a1 (Glut1) via histone modification. Upon beta-OHB treatment, Slc2a1 expression was up-regulated, with a concomitant increase in H3K9 acetylation at the critical cis-regulatory region of the Slc2a1 gene in brain microvascular endothelial cells and NB2a neuronal cells, shown by quantitative PCR analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of the Hdac2 gene increased Slc2a1 expression, suggesting that it is one of the responsible histone deacetylases (HDACs). These results confirm that beta-OHB is a HDAC inhibitor and show that beta-OHB plays an important role in fasting-induced epigenetic activation of a glucose transporter gene in the brain.",0,adult Sprague Dawley rat kidneys; isolated perfused kidney model,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"vacuolization, no-change",Cell Death & Survival,kidney,Kidney,renal tubular epithelial cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,vacuoles,Vacuole,Unspecified,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Metabolic & Endocrine,"vacuolization extent, no-change","Brain injury, no-change",20 mM of beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Additional treatments included perfusion with triglycerides with 20 mM of beta-hydroxybutyrate and 2 mM of acetoacetate (n = 5) and perfusion with triglycerides with 70 mM of glucose (n = 1). Basal vacuolization was produced in all groups, but differed in morphology to that reported in postmortem studies. There was no further increase in vacuolization after 2 h of perfusion compared to 1 h (p = 0.24), and the addition of ketones did not alter the morphology or extent of vacuolization.

28085920,A ketogenic diet rescues hippocampal memory defects in a mouse model of Kabuki syndrome.,"Kabuki syndrome is a Mendelian intellectual disability syndrome caused by mutations in either of two genes (KMT2D and KDM6A) involved in chromatin accessibility. We previously showed that an agent that promotes chromatin opening, the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) AR-42, ameliorates the deficiency of adult neurogenesis in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and rescues hippocampal memory defects in a mouse model of Kabuki syndrome (Kmt2d(+/betaGeo)). Unlike a drug, a dietary intervention could be quickly transitioned to the clinic. Therefore, we have explored whether treatment with a ketogenic diet could lead to a similar rescue through increased amounts of beta-hydroxybutyrate, an endogenous HDACi. Here, we report that a ketogenic diet in Kmt2d(+/betaGeo) mice modulates H3ac and H3K4me3 in the granule cell layer, with concomitant rescue of both the neurogenesis defect and hippocampal memory abnormalities seen in Kmt2d(+/betaGeo) mice; similar effects on neurogenesis were observed on exogenous administration of beta-hydroxybutyrate. These data suggest that dietary modulation of epigenetic modifications through elevation of beta-hydroxybutyrate may provide a feasible strategy to treat the intellectual disability seen in Kabuki syndrome and related disorders.",GJA1; 0,E2F6-transgenic mice; neonatal cardiomyocytes (E2F6-Tg); neonatal cardiomyocytes (Wt),animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells,"ketone signaling, up",Metabolic Regulation,myocardium,Heart,neonatal cardiomyocytes,Muscle – Cardiac,Cardiomyocytes,gap junction,Cell Junctions & Adhesion,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
28098426,E2F6 Impairs Glycolysis and Activates BDH1 Expression Prior to Dilated Cardiomyopathy.,"RATIONALE: The E2F pathway plays a critical role in cardiac growth and development, yet its role in cardiac metabolism remains to be defined. Metabolic changes play important roles in human heart failure and studies imply the ketogenic enzyme beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase I (BDH1) is a potential biomarker. OBJECTIVE: To define the role of the E2F pathway in cardiac metabolism and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with a focus on BDH1. METHODS AND RESULTS: We previously developed transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the transcriptional repressor, E2F6, to interfere with the E2F/Rb pathway in post-natal myocardium. These Tg mice present with an E2F6 dose dependent DCM and deregulated connexin-43 (CX-43) levels in myocardium. Using the Seahorse platform, a 22% decrease in glycolysis was noted in neonatal cardiomyocytes isolated from E2F6-Tg hearts. This was associated with a 39% reduction in the glucose transporter GLUT4 and 50% less activation of the regulator of glucose metabolism AKT2. The specific reduction of cyclin B1 (70%) in Tg myocardium implicates its importance in supporting glycolysis in the postnatal heart. No changes in cyclin D expression (known to regulate mitochondrial activity) were noted and lipid metabolism remained unchanged in neonatal cardiomyocytes from Tg hearts. However, E2F6 induced a 40-fold increase of the Bdh1 transcript and 890% increase in its protein levels in hearts from Tg pups implying a potential impact on ketolysis. By contrast, BDH1 expression is not activated until adulthood in normal myocardium. Neonatal cardiomyocytes from Wt hearts incubated with the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) showed a 100% increase in CX-43 protein levels, implying a role for ketone signaling in gap junction biology. Neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures from Tg hearts exhibited enhanced levels of BDH1 and CX-43 and were not responsive to beta-OHB. CONCLUSIONS: The data reveal a novel role for the E2F pathway in regulating glycolysis in the developing myocardium through a mechanism involving cyclin B1. We reveal BDH1 expression as an early biomarker of heart failure and its potential impact, through ketone signaling, on CX-43 levels in E2F6-induced DCM.",0,"70 patients with T1DM receiving insulin and dapagliflozin (1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg) or placebo",human,Multi-model,"glucose-lowering effect of dapagliflozin-insulin combination therapy, down",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Metabolic & Endocrine,"risk of DKA, up","Diabetic ketoacidosis risk, up",NS,NS,NS

METHODS: A post hoc exploratory correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationship between change in TDD and (1) 24-hour mean glucose, assessed by continuous glucose monitoring, and (2) fasting beta-hydroxybutyrate, in 70 patients with T1DM receiving insulin and dapagliflozin (1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg) or placebo. The pharmacodynamic effect of dapagliflozin was estimated as a virtual ""insulin dose"" using 24-hour urinary glucose excretion values and a recognized insulin-to-carbohydrate counting technique. RESULTS: Trends for correlations were observed between change in TDD and 24-hour glucose (day 7: r = -0.264, P = .056) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (day 7: r = -0.187, P = .133; day 14: r = -0.274, P = .047). The pharmacodynamic effect of dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg was estimated as equivalent to ~20% of baseline TDD. Higher mean and maximum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were observed on days 7 and 14 in patients with a TDD reduction >20% vs </=20%. CONCLUSIONS: Over 14 days, decreasing the insulin dose diminished the glucose-lowering effect of dapagliflozin-insulin combination therapy and increased levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate. While insulin dose adjustments should always be individualized, these analyses suggest that, as a general rule, TDD reduction in dapagliflozin-treated patients with T1DM should not exceed 20%, to ensure glycaemic control does not deteriorate and to mitigate the potential for an increased risk of DKA.",0,3xTgAD mice; patients with Alzheimer's disease,animal; human,Animal – Mouse; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"mitochondrial [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio, down",Multiple mechanisms,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"energy metabolism, up","Energy expenditure, up","ketone ester (ester of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate and R-1,3 butane diol) in rodent diet",Multi-source,D-BHB

The metabolism of ketones in the brain by-passes glycolysis and therefore may correct several deficiencies that are associated with glucose hypometabolism. A dietary supplement composed of an ester of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate and R-1,3 butane diol referred to as ketone ester (KE) was incorporated into a rodent diet and fed to 3xTgAD mice for 8 months. At 16.5 months of age animals were killed and brains dissected. Analyses were carried out on the hippocampus and frontal cortex for glycolytic and TCA (Tricarboxylic Acid) cycle intermediates, amino acids, oxidized lipids and proteins, and enzymes. There were higher concentrations of d-beta-hydroxybutyrate in the hippocampus of KE-fed mice where there were also higher concentrations of TCA cycle and glycolytic intermediates and the energy-linked biomarker, N-acetyl aspartate compared to controls. In the hippocampi of control-fed animals the free mitochondrial [NAD(+) ]/[NADH] ratio were highly oxidized, whereas, in KE-fed animals the mitochondria were reduced. Also, the levels of oxidized protein and lipids were lower and the energy of ATP hydrolysis was greater compared to controls. 3xTgAD mice maintained on a KE-supplemented diet had higher concentrations of glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolites, a more reduced mitochondrial redox potential, and lower amounts of oxidized lipids and proteins in their hippocampi compared to controls. The KE offers a potential therapy to counter fundamental metabolic deficits common to patients and transgenic models.

28316020,beta-Hydroxybutyrate Deactivates Neutrophil NLRP3 Inflammasome to Relieve Gout Flares.,"Aging and lipotoxicity are two major risk factors for gout that are linked by the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Neutrophil-mediated production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) drives gouty flares that cause joint destruction, intense pain, and fever. However, metabolites that impact neutrophil inflammasome remain unknown. Here, we identified that ketogenic diet (KD) increases beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and alleviates urate crystal-induced gout without impairing immune defense against bacterial infection. BHB inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome in S100A9 fibril-primed and urate crystal-activated macrophages, which serve to recruit inflammatory neutrophils in joints. Consistent with reduced gouty flares in rats fed a ketogenic diet, BHB blocked IL-1beta in neutrophils in a NLRP3-dependent manner in mice and humans irrespective of age. Mechanistically, BHB inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils by reducing priming and assembly steps. Collectively, our studies show that BHB, a known alternate metabolic fuel, is also an anti-inflammatory molecule that may serve as a treatment for gout.",0,guinea pig cortical brain slices,animal; in vitro,Multi-model,"mitochondrial metabolism, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,cortical brain,Brain/CNS,GABAergic neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",[U-(13)C]D-betaOHB,In vitro media supplementation,D-BHB

To examine the extent and circumstances by which betaOHB can supplement glucose metabolism, we studied guinea pig cortical brain slices using increasing concentrations of [U-(13)C]D-betaOHB in conjunction with [1-(13)C]D-glucose under conditions of normo- and hypoglycaemia, as well as under high potassium (40 mmol/L K(+)) depolarization in normo- and hypoglycaemic conditions. The contribution of betaOHB to synthesis of GABA was also probed by inhibiting the synthesis of glutamine, a GABA precursor, with methionine sulfoximine (MSO). [U-(13)C]D-betaOHB at lower concentrations (0.25 and 1.25 mmol/L) stimulated mitochondrial metabolism, producing greater total incorporation of label into glutamate and GABA but did not have a similar effect in the cytosolic compartment where labelling of glutamine was reduced at 1.25 mmol/L [U-(13)C]D-betaOHB. At higher concentrations (2.5 mmol/L) [U-(13)C]D-betaOHB inhibited metabolism of [1-(13)C]D-glucose, and reduced total label incorporation and total metabolite pools. When glucose levels were reduced, betaOHB was able to partially restore the loss of glutamate and GABA caused by hypoglycaemia, but was not able to supplement levels of lactate, glutamine or alanine or to prevent the increase in aspartate. Under depolarizing conditions glucose was the preferred substrate over betaOHB, even in hypoglycaemic conditions where comparatively less betaOHB was incorporated except into aspartate isotopomers. Inhibition of glutamine synthesis with MSO had no significant effect on incorporation of label from [U-(13)C]D-betaOHB into GABA C2,1 indicating that the majority of this GABA was synthesized in GABAergic neurons from [U-(13)C]D-betaOHB rather than from Gln C4,5 imported from astrocytes.",FOXO3; CAT; SOD2; IL1B; IL18; NLRP3,mice; moderate-severe thoracic spinal contusion injury (T9-10),animal,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Other Mammal,"NLRP3 inflammasome activation, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,spinal cord,Spinal cord,motor neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Spinal cord injury,Injury & Trauma,"locomotor function, up; pain hypersensitivity, down","Locomotor activity, up; Pain sensitivity, down",exogenous D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DBHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of administration of exogenous D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DBHB) on functional recovery and neuropathic pain in spinal cord-injured mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mice were given a moderate-severe thoracic spinal contusion injury at the T(9-10) level and treated with exogenous DBHB. KEY RESULTS: Treatment of SCI mice with DBHB markedly improved locomotor function and relieved SCI-induced hypersensitivities to mechanical and thermal stimulation. DBHB treatment partly prevented the SCI-induced loss of motor neurons and suppressed microglial and glial activation. DBHB treatment enhanced histone acetylation and up-regulated expression of the transcription factor FOXO3a, catalase and SOD2 in injured region of SCI mice. DBHB treatment suppressed SCI-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reduced protein expression of IL-1beta and IL-18. In addition, DBHB treatment improved mitochondrial function and abated oxidative stress following SCI. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: DBHB promoted functional recovery and relieved pain hypersensitivity in mice with SCI, possibly through inhibition of histone deacetylation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and preservation of mitochondrial function. DBHB could thus be envisaged as a potential use of interventions for SCI but remains to be tested in humans.",0,Sprague-Dawley rat; hemorrhagic shock (60% blood loss),animal,Animal – Rat; NS,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hemorrhagic shock,Injury & Trauma,"survival, up","Survival, up",4 M D-stereoisomer of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

A previous study of this therapy tested only one concentration of three specific components: 4 M D-stereoisomer of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), 43 mM melatonin, and 20% DMSO. In this study, we considered the range of concentrations of BHB and melatonin seen during the physiological extremes of rapid arousal from hypothermic torpor in natural hibernators and applied these to the non-hibernating Sprague-Dawley rat model. These extremes normally result in ischemia and reperfusion injury in non-hibernating mammals. Dose-ranging studies were conducted for BHB and melatonin in rats with 60% blood loss. BHB was administered at either 4, 2, or 0.4 M concentration in conjunction with 4.3 mM melatonin and 10% DMSO. Subsequently, melatonin was administered at either 4.3, 0.43, 0.0043, 0.000043, or 0 mM in conjunction with 4 M BHB and 2% DMSO. 10-day mean survival showed a dose-dependent trend: rats survived longer with higher concentration of infused BHB (4 M BHB, 7.38 +/- 1.75 days; 2 M BHB, 5.25 +/- 2.22 days; 0.4 M BHB, 2.07 +/- 2.05 days). Administering 4 M BHB without melatonin resulted in low mean survival times (4.38 +/- 1.42 days). All treatments containing both 4 M BHB and melatonin, regardless of melatonin concentration, resulted in mean survival times of ~7.5 days.

Furthermore, glucose replenishment following hypoglycemic coma induces neuronal cell death. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying glucose deficiency-induced cytotoxicity and the protective effect of d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB) using SH-SY5Y cells. The cytotoxic mechanism of metformin under glucose deficiency was also examined. Cell viability under 1 mM glucose (glucose deficiency) was significantly decreased which was accompanied by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and glycogen synthase 3 (GSK3beta). ROS inhibitor reversed the glucose deficiency-induced cytotoxicity and restored the reduced phosphorylation of ERK and GSK3beta. While metformin did not alter cell viability in normal glucose media, it further increased cell death and ROS production under glucose deficiency. However, D-BHB reversed cytotoxicity, ROS production, and the decrease in phosphorylation of ERK and GSK3beta induced by the glucose deficiency. ERK inhibitor reversed the D-BHB-induced increase in cell viability under glucose deficiency, whereas GSK3beta inhibitor did not restore glucose deficiency-induced cytotoxicity. Finally, the protective effect of D-BHB against glucose deficiency was confirmed in primary neuronal cells.

Effective interventions to antagonize hypobaric hypoxia-induced memory impairment are in urgent need. Ketogenic diet (KD) has been successfully used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy and improves cognitive behaviors in epilepsy patients and other pathophysiological animal models. In the present study, we aimed to explore the potential beneficial effects of a KD on memory impairment caused by hypobaric hypoxia and the underlying possible mechanisms. We showed that the KD recipe used was ketogenic and increased plasma levels of ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate. The results of the behavior tests showed that the KD did not affect general locomotor activity but obviously promoted spatial learning. Moreover, the KD significantly improved the spatial memory impairment caused by hypobaric hypoxia (simulated altitude of 6000 m, 24 h). In addition, the improving-effect of KD was mimicked by intraperitoneal injection of BHB. The western blot and immunohistochemistry results showed that KD treatment not only increased the acetylated levels of histone H3 and histone H4 compared to that of the control group but also antagonized the decrease in the acetylated histone H3 and H4 when exposed to hypobaric hypoxia. Furthermore, KD-hypoxia treatment also promoted PKA/CREB activation and BDNF protein expression compared to the effects of hypoxia alone. These results demonstrated that KD is a promising strategy to improve spatial memory impairment caused by hypobaric hypoxia, in which increased modification of histone acetylation plays an important role.",0,"eas ""bang-sensitive"" (BS) mutant strain of Drosophila",animal; in vitro,Animal – Invertebrate,"K(atp) channel activity, nan; GABA(b) signaling, NS",Ion & Nutrient Transport; Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,NS,NS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"seizure-like activity, down","Seizure activity, down",Direct application of the KB beta-HB to food,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

The KD results in elevated production of ketone bodies (KB's), such as beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), which are thought to have anticonvulsant properties; however, their exact mechanism of action is unknown. In vitro, KB effects on reducing neuronal firing rates are mediated in part by K(atp) channel activity and GABA(b) signaling. In order to study metabolic and pharmacological effects in a whole-animal model, we used the eas ""bang-sensitive"" (BS) mutant strain of Drosophila, which exhibits seizure-like activity (SLA) upon mechanical stimulation. Direct application of the KB beta-HB to food reduced BS SLA. Application either of tolbutamide, a K(atp) blocker, or of CGP-55845, a GABA(b) antagonist, concomitantly with beta-HB, partially reversed these KB effects on SLA, verifying a role for K(atp) channels and GABA(b) signaling in mediating the anticonvulsant effects of KB's and validating this whole-animal model of KD effects on seizure.",INS,well-trained male athletes,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"insulin levels, up",Hormonal Regulation,skeletal muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketone monoester drink,Ketone ester (KE),D-BHB
28450882,A Ketone Ester Drink Increases Postexercise Muscle Glycogen Synthesis in Humans.,"INTRODUCTION: Physical endurance can be limited by muscle glycogen stores, in that glycogen depletion markedly reduces external work. During carbohydrate restriction, the liver synthesizes the ketone bodies, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate from fatty acids. In animals and in the presence of glucose, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate promotes insulin secretion and increases glycogen synthesis. Here we determined whether a dietary ketone ester, combined with plentiful glucose, can increase postexercise glycogen synthesis in human skeletal muscle. METHODS: After an interval-based glycogen depletion exercise protocol, 12 well-trained male athletes completed a randomized, three-arm, blinded crossover recovery study that consisted of consumption of either a taste-matched, zero-calorie control or a ketone monoester drink, followed by a 10-mM glucose clamp or saline infusion for 2 h. The three postexercise conditions were control drink then saline infusion, control drink then hyperglycemic clamp, or ketone ester drink then hyperglycemic clamp. Skeletal muscle glycogen content was determined in muscle biopsies of vastus lateralis taken before and after the 2-h clamps. RESULTS: The ketone ester drink increased blood D-beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations to a maximum of 5.3 versus 0.7 mM for the control drink (P < 0.0001). During the 2-h glucose clamps, insulin levels were twofold higher (31 vs 16 mU.L, P < 0.01) and glucose uptake 32% faster (1.66 vs 1.26 g.kg, P < 0.001). The ketone drink increased by 61 g, the total glucose infused for 2 h, from 197 to 258 g, and muscle glycogen was 50% higher (246 vs 164 mmol glycosyl units per kilogram dry weight, P < 0.05) than after the control drink. CONCLUSION: In the presence of constant high glucose concentrations, a ketone ester drink increased endogenous insulin levels, glucose uptake, and muscle glycogen synthesis.",0,Wistar rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,visceral fat,Adipose tissue,adipocyte,Adipose,White adipocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"visceral fat mass, down","Body fat mass, down",betaHB mineral salt mixture,Ketone salt (KS),NS
28489728,"Oral beta-hydroxybutyrate increases ketonemia, decreases visceral adipocyte volume and improves serum lipid profile in Wistar rats.","BACKGROUND: Ketosis can be induced in humans and in animals by fasting or dietary interventions, such as ketogenic diets. However, the increasing interest on the ketogenic state has motivated the development of alternative approaches to rapidly increase ketonemia using less drastic interventions. Here, it was tested whether oral intake of a beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) mineral salt mixture could increase ketonemia in Wistar rats without any other dietary changes, thereby being a useful model to study ketones effects alone on metabolism. METHODS: betaHB salts were orally administered to provoke elevation in the ketonemia. Effects of this intervention were tested acutely (by gavage) and chronically (4 weeks in drinking water). Acutely, a concomitant glucose overload was used to suppress endogenous ketogenesis and verify whether betaHB salts were really absorbed or not. Long-term administration allowed to weekly evaluate the impact on ketonemia, blood glucose and, after 4 weeks, on body weight, visceral fat mass, lipid blood profile, serum lipolysis products and adiponectinemia. RESULTS: betaHB salts increased ketonemia in acute and long-term administrations, improved blood lipid profile by raising HDL-cholesterol concentration and decreasing LDL/HDL ratio, while reduced visceral adipocyte volume. Mean ketonemia correlated positively with HDLc and negatively with adipocyte volume and serum lipolysis products. CONCLUSIONS: Oral betaHB can rapidly increase ketonemia and, therefore, be used as an acute and long-term animal model of ketosis. Long-term treatment points to important beneficial effects of ketone bodies in serum lipid concentrations and visceral fat mass. These results may help to explain the metabolic adaptations following ketogenic diets, such as a better body fat control and a serum lipid profile improvement.",SDC1,Sprague-Dawley male rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"glycocalyx restoration, up",Extracellular Matrix & Structural Remodeling,cremaster venules,Vasculature,endothelial cells,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hemorrhagic shock,Injury & Trauma,"glycocalyx thickness, up","Endothelial function, up",beta-hydroxybutyrate plus melatonin (BHB/M),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
28555095,Novel Adjunct Drugs Reverse Endothelial Glycocalyx Damage After Hemorrhagic Shock in Rats.,"INTRODUCTION: There is interest in the small-volume therapeutic use of adjunct drugs for treating hemorrhagic shock (HS). However, critical information is only partially available on mechanisms of action of promising compounds such as adenosine-lidocaine-magnesium (ALM), beta-hydroxybutyrate plus melatonin (BHB/M), and poloxamer 188 (P-188). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that these adjuncts would reverse HS-induced damage to microvascular endothelial glycocalyx and hemodynamics. METHODS: After baseline, 40% of total blood volume was removed from 44 anesthetized Sprague-Dawley male rats. One hour after hemorrhage, animals were resuscitated using ALM, BHB/M, or P-188 followed by lactated Ringer's (LR, 15 mL/kg). Control animals were not treated (SHAM) or received LR alone. Sampled blood was used to quantify shed syndecan-1 in plasma; multiple systemic physiological parameters were recorded. In vivo glycocalyx thickness, microvascular permeability, and microhemodynamics were evaluated in >200 cremaster venules using intravital videomicroscopy. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, resuscitation using adjuncts was associated with glycocalyx restoration of 97 +/- 9% (ALM), 75 +/- 8% (BHB/M), and 85 +/- 5% (P-188): significantly higher than LR-only (56 +/- 4%). Significantly better permeability, similar to SHAM values, was measured after ALM and P-188, and low plasma syndecan-1 levels were measured after resuscitation with all adjuncts. Microhemodynamic changes were relatively small while systemic parameters such as mean arterial pressure and lactate improved but remained below or above the baseline, respectively, as expected from this hypotensive resuscitation model. CONCLUSION: The drugs ALM, BHB/M, and P-188 provide beneficial effects as adjuncts to hypotensive resuscitation in this HS model by mechanisms involving changes at the microvascular level including the glycocalyx.",BDNF; 0; SLC2A1; SLC2A3; POMC; CORT,Adult male Sprague Dawley rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"ketogenesis, up",Metabolic Regulation,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,neuronal,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Chronic stress,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"cognition, up","Cognition, up",endogenous ketosis; exogenous ketones; ketogenic (KD); ketone supplemented (KS),NS; Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid); Ketogenic diet (endogenous); Ketone salt (KS),NS
28583851,Nutritional Ketosis Affects Metabolism and Behavior in Sprague-Dawley Rats in Both Control and Chronic Stress Environments.,"Nutritional ketosis may enhance cerebral energy metabolism and has received increased interest as a way to improve or preserve performance and resilience. Most studies to date have focused on metabolic or neurological disorders while anecdotal evidence suggests that ketosis may enhance performance in the absence of underlying dysfunction. Moreover, decreased availability of glucose in the brain following stressful events is associated with impaired cognition, suggesting the need for more efficient energy sources. We tested the hypotheses that ketosis induced by endogenous or exogenous ketones could: (a) augment cognitive outcomes in healthy subjects; and (b) prevent stress-induced detriments in cognitive parameters. Adult, male, Sprague Dawley rats were used to investigate metabolic and behavioral outcomes in 3 dietary conditions: ketogenic (KD), ketone supplemented (KS), or NIH-31 control diet in both control or chronic stress conditions. Acute administration of exogenous ketones resulted in reduction in blood glucose and sustained ketosis. Chronic experiments showed that in control conditions, only KD resulted in pronounced metabolic alterations and improved performance in the novel object recognition test. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response revealed that KD-fed rats maintained peripheral ketosis despite increases in glucose whereas no diet effects were observed in ACTH or CORT levels. Both KD and KS-fed rats decreased escape latencies on the third day of water maze, whereas only KD prevented stress-induced deficits on the last testing day and improved probe test performance. Stress-induced decrease in hippocampal levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate was attenuated in KD group while both KD and KS prevented stress effects on BDNF levels. Mitochondrial enzymes associated with ketogenesis were increased in both KD and KS hippocampal samples and both endothelial and neuronal glucose transporters were affected by stress but only in the control diet group. Our results highlight the complex relationship between peripheral metabolism, behavioral performance and biochemical changes in the hippocampus. Endogenous ketosis improved behavioral and metabolic parameters associated with energy metabolism and cognition while ketone supplementation replicated the biochemical effects within the hippocampus but only showed modest effects on behavioral improvements.",0; BDNF,mice; cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; NS,"histone modification (H3k9bhb), up",Epigenetic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Major depressive disorder,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"depressive behaviors, down","Depressive-like behavior, down",Exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Metabolite changes in vivo after stress contribute to histone modification. Histone3-lysine9-beta-hydroxybutyrylation (H3k9bhb), a novel histone modification mark induced by beta-hydroxybutyrate, may participate in the development of depression. To examine the role of H3k9bhb in depression, experiments were performed on mice and cells. H3k9bhb were reduced in the brain of depressive mice. Exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate ameliorated depressive behaviors and reversed the reduction of H3K9bhb and BDNF. We showed that H3k9bhb played a role in depression, and firstly linked BHB and BDNF via H3k9bhb. Our findings emphasized the crucial role of metabolic regulation on epigenetics in depression.",0,Long-Evans rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketogenic diet; beta-hydroxybutyrate,Ketogenic diet (endogenous); Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
28672997,The ketogenic diet affects the social behavior of young male rats.,"The positive effects of the ketogenic diet (KD) on social behavior have been recently reported in patients and rodent models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Given the beneficial effects of the KD on epilepsy, mitochondrial function, carbohydrate metabolism, and inflammation, treatment based on the KD has the potential to reduce some of the ASD-associated symptoms, including abnormal social interactions. It is not known whether the KD influences sociability by reducing the pathological processes underlying ASD or through some independent mechanism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of the KD on the social behavior of rats. Four-week-old Long-Evans males were treated with the KD for 4 subsequent weeks. Afterwards, behavioral tests were performed in order to evaluate sociability, locomotor activity, working memory, and anxiety-related behaviors. Additionally we performed the social interaction test in animals that were receiving beta-hydroxybutyrate or acetone. We have observed that rats fed with the KD showed increased social exploration in three different experimental settings. We did not observe any changes in the level of social interactions in animals treated with exogenous ketone bodies. The results did not show any difference in mobility or anxiety-related behaviors or working memory between the animals fed with the KD or standard rodent chow. In conclusion, we showed that the KD affects the social behavior of wild-type young adult male rats, which was not associated with other behavioral changes.",0,male Wistar rats; kainic acid (KA)-induced rat seizure model,animal,Animal – Rat,"blood BHB concentration, up",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"seizure onset time, up; neuronal loss, down; mossy fiber sprouting, down","Seizure activity, up; Neuronal survival, down; Neuroinflammation, down",exogenous BHB (intraperitoneal injection),Intraperitoneal BHB,NS

The concentrations of BHB and glucose were detected in the blood prior to exogenous BHB administration. Three different doses of BHB (2, 4 and 8 mmol/kg) were then injected into male Wistar rats intraperitoneally, and the concentrations of BHB and glucose in the blood were detected. Rats received 0.9% normal saline intraperitoneally at a dose of 4 ml/kg as a control. Subsequently, a KA-induced rat seizure model was established and the anticonvulsant effects of BHB were investigated. The onset time of seizure and the degree of seizure behavior were recorded. Nissl and Timm staining were used to evaluate neuronal loss and mossy fiber sprouting, respectively. The present study demonstrated that exogenous BHB administration could significantly increase BHB concentration in the blood and this concentration was maintained for 90 min without affecting blood glucose levels. Furthermore, it was determined that a dose of 4 mmol/kg BHB is optimal for exogenous administration. The onset time of seizure was significantly prolonged in BHB-pretreated rats (63.31+/-4.050 min) compared with the control group (37.08+/-1.958 min; P=0.039). In addition, neuronal loss and mossy fiber sprouting were both alleviated in the BHB-pretreated model group. Exogenous BHB administration at a dose of 4 mmol/kg may be an alternative to a ketogenic diet to exert a protective effect in the epileptic model induced by KA. The results of the present study may allow novel therapeutic strategies to be developed to treat epilepsy.",CYBB; NOX4; FOXO3; SOD2; CAT; HDAC1; HDAC2; HDAC3; HDAC8,rat C5 hemi-contusion; PC12 cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"inhibition of class I HDACs, down",Epigenetic Regulation,spinal cord,Spinal cord,PC12 cells,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Spinal cord injury,Injury & Trauma,"neuroprotection, positive","Neuroprotection, positive",ketogenic diet (KD),Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
28685447,The Ketone Metabolite beta-Hydroxybutyrate Attenuates Oxidative Stress in Spinal Cord Injury by Suppression of Class I Histone Deacetylases.,"The ketone metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), is reported to be neuroprotective after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. The present study aims to investigate effects of betaOHB on suppression of oxidative stress and inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) in in vivo and in vitro models. Rats were fed with ketogenic diet (KD) or standard diet (SD) for 3 weeks. A C5 hemi-contusion injury was applied to these animals on the 14th day of experiment, and spinal cord samples were harvested on the 1st, 3rd and 7th days after SCI, respectively. The blood ketone levels were significantly higher in the KD groups. KD reduced oxidative stress markers and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products, downregulated the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)2 and NOX4, and upregulated the expression of forkhead box group O (FOXO)3a, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and catalase after SCI. The in vitro study, performed on PC12 cells, indicated that betaOHB inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced ROS production, decreased NOX2 and NOX4 protein levels, and upregulated FOXO3a, MnSOD, and catalase levels in a dose-dependent manner, which was consistent with the in vivo results. The ketone metabolite betaOHB inhibited HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 activity, but not HDAC8 in SCI rats and PC12 cells. Depletion of HDAC1 or HDAC2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced ROS production and protein carbonylation and elevated FOXO3a protein levels, meanwhile reducing NOX2 and NOX4 protein expression in PC12 cells. Our results indicate that the ketone metabolite betaOHB attenuates oxidative stress in SCI by inhibition of class I HDACs, and selected suppression of HDAC1 or HDAC2 regulates FOXO3a, NOX2, and NOX4 expression. Therefore, the ketone metabolite betaOHB may be a novel promising therapeutic agent for SCI.",HIF1A; AKT1; 0,rats; mice,animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Mouse,"upregulation of cytoprotective pathways, up",Cell Death & Survival,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Ischemic stroke,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"infarct volume, down","Infarct size, down",KG diet,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
28750585,Diet-Induced Ketosis Protects Against Focal Cerebral Ischemia in Mouse.,"Over the past decade we have consistently shown that ketosis is neuroprotective against ischemic insults in rats. We reported that diet-induced ketotic rats had a significant reduction in infarct volume when subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and improved survival and recovery after cardiac arrest and resuscitation. The neuroprotective mechanisms of ketosis (via ketogenic diet; KG) include (i) ketones are alternate energy substrates that can restore energy balance when glucose metabolism is deficient and (ii) ketones modulate cell-signalling pathways that are cytoprotective. We investigated the effects of diet-induced ketosis following transient focal cerebral ischemia in mice. The correlation between levels of ketosis and hypoxic inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), AKT (also known as protein kinase B or PKB) and 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were determined. Mice were fed with KG diet or standard lab-chow (STD) diet for 4 weeks. For the MCAO group, mice underwent 60 min of MCAO and total brain infarct volumes were evaluated 48 h after reperfusion. In a separate group of mice, brain tissue metabolites, levels of HIF-1alpha, phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), and AMPK were measured. After feeding a KG diet, levels of blood ketone bodies (beta-hydroxyburyrate, BHB) were increased. There was a proportional decrease in infarct volumes with increased blood BHB levels (KG vs STD; 4.2 +/- 0.6 vs 7.8 +/- 2.2 mm(3), mean +/- SEM). A positive correlation was also observed with HIF-1alpha and pAKT relative to blood BHB levels. Our results showed that chronic ketosis can be induced in mice by KG diet and was neuroprotective against focal cerebral ischemia in a concentration dependent manner. Potential mechanisms include upregulation of cytoprotective pathways such as those associated with HIF-1alpha, pAKT and AMPK.",0,healthy adult males (n=10),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"fat oxidation, up",Metabolic Regulation,plasma,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"time-trial power output, down","Exercise capacity, down",ketone salts (0.3 g/kg),Ketone salt (KS),NS

Ten healthy adult males (age, 23 +/- 3 years; body mass index, 25 +/- 3 kg/m(2), peak oxygen uptake, 45 +/- 10 mL/(kg.min)(-1)) were recruited to complete 2 experimental trials. Before enrollment in the experimental conditions, baseline anthropometrics and cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen uptake) were assessed and familiarization to the study protocol was provided. On experimental days, participants reported to the laboratory in the fasted state and consumed either 0.3 g/kg beta-OHB ketone salts or a flavour-matched placebo at 30 min prior to engaging in cycling exercise. Subjects completed steady-state exercise at 30%, 60%, and 90% ventilatory threshold (VT) followed by a 150-kJ cycling time-trial. Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and total substrate oxidation were derived from indirect calorimetry. Plasma glucose, lactate, and ketones were measured at baseline, 30 min post-supplement, post-steady-state exercise, and immediately following the time-trial. Plasma beta-OHB was elevated from baseline and throughout the entire protocol in the ketone condition (p < 0.05). RER was lower at 30% and 60% VT in the ketone compared with control condition. Total fat oxidation was greater in the ketone versus control (p = 0.05). Average time-trial power output was approximately 7% lower (-16 W, p = 0.029) in the ketone condition. Ingestion of ketone salts prior to exercise increases fat oxidation during steady-state exercise but impairs high-intensity exercise performance.",0,genetically absence epileptic Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"adenosinergic A(1)R-mediated modulation, NS",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"spike-wave discharge (SWD) number, down","Seizure activity, down","ketone ester (KE, 2.5 g/kg/day); ketone salt/KS + medium chain triglyceride/MCT (KSMCT, 2.5 g/kg/day), gavage",Ketone ester (KE); Multi-source,NS
28825993,Adenosine A1 Receptor Antagonism Abolished the Anti-seizure Effects of Exogenous Ketone Supplementation in Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk Rats.,"The state of therapeutic ketosis can be achieved by using the ketogenic diet (KD) or exogenous ketone supplementation. It was suggested previously that the adenosinergic system may be involved in the mediating effect of KD on suppressing seizure activity in different types of epilepsies, likely by means of adenosine A(1) receptors (A(1)Rs). Thus, we tested in the present study whether exogenous ketone supplements (ketone ester: KE, 2.5 g/kg/day; ketone salt/KS + medium chain triglyceride/MCT: KSMCT, 2.5 g/kg/day) applied sub-chronically (for 7 days) by intragastric gavage can modulate absence epileptic activity in genetically absence epileptic Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats. The number of spike-wave discharges (SWDs) significantly and similarly decreased after both KE and KSMCT treatment between 3rd and 7th days of gavage. Moreover, blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) levels were significantly increased alike after KE and KSMCT gavage, compared to control levels. The SWD number and betaHB levels returned to the baseline levels on the first day without ketone supplementation. To determine whether A(1)Rs can modify ketone supplement-evoked changes in absence epileptic activity, we applied a non-pro-epileptic dose of a specific A(1)R antagonist DPCPX (1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine) (intraperitoneal/i.p. 0.2 mg/kg) in combination with KSMCT (2.5 g/kg/day, gavage). As expected, DPCPX abolished the KSMCT-evoked decrease in SWD number. Thus, we concluded that application of exogenous ketone supplements may decrease absence epileptic activity in WAG/Rij rats. Moreover, our results suggest that among others the adenosinergic system, likely via A(1)Rs, may modulate the exogenous ketone supplements-evoked anti-seizure effects.",0,ovine small pre-antral follicles (SPFs); ovine large pre-antral follicles (LPFs),animal; in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal,"survival and growth inhibition, down",Multiple mechanisms,pre-antral follicle,Ovary,oocyte,Reproductive – Female,Granulosa cells,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Decline in fertility,Reproductive & Pregnancy,"survival and growth of preantral follicles, down","Survival, down",beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Small pre-antral follicles (SPFs, 100-250 mum) and large pre-antral follicles (LPFs, 250-450 mum) were isolated from slaughterhouse ovaries by a mechanical cum enzymatic method. SPFs and LPFs were cultured in vitro for 14 and 7 days respectively and examined for their growth, survival and growth rates of enclosed oocytes in PFs exposed with different concentration of ammonia (0, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 and 400 muM), urea (0, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5,6, 7 and 8 mM), NEFA [Basal NEFA (70 muM): stearic acid, SA (10 muM)+Palmitic acid, PA(20 muM)+oleic acid, OA(40 muM), b) Medium combo (140 muM): SA (20 muM)+ PA(40 muM)+ OA(80 muM), c) High combo (210 muM): SA (30 muM)+PA(60 muM)+OA(120 muM), d) Very high Combo (280 muM): SA(40 muM)+PA(80 muM)+OA(160 muM)] and BHB (0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 muM).

29058362,The Ketone Body beta-Hydroxybutyrate Does Not Inhibit Synuclein Mediated Inflammasome Activation in Microglia.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is recognized as the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and results in debilitating motor deficits. The accumulation and spread of neurotoxic synuclein aggregates in the form of Lewy bodies is a key pathological feature of PD. Chronic activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by protein aggregates is emerging as a major pathogenic mechanism in progressive neurodegenerative disorders and is considered an important therapeutic target. Recently the ketone body, beta-hydroxy butyrate (BHB), was shown to efficiently inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, and in vivo models of inflammatory disease. Furthermore, BHB can readily cross the blood brain barrier suggesting that it could have therapeutic benefits for the management of PD. In this study, we evaluated if BHB could inhibit chronic microglial inflammasome activation induced by pathological fibrillar synuclein aggregates. Interestingly, we found that BHB treatment almost completely blocked all aspects of inflammasome activation and pyroptosis induced by ATP and monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, consistent with previously published reports in macrophages. Surprisingly however, BHB did not inhibit inflammasome activation and release of IL-1beta or caspase-1 induced by synuclein fibrils. Our results demonstrate that BHB does not block the upstream pathways regulating inflammasome activation by synuclein fibrils and suggest that synuclein mediated inflammasome activation proceeds via distinct mechanisms compared to traditional NLRP3 activators such as ATP and MSU.",RAC1; CDC42; AKT1,murine microglia; LPS neuroinflammatory model; chronic unpredictable stress (CUS); fasting; low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD),animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Other Mammal; NS; Human – Interventional,"Akt-small RhoGTPase (Rac1/Cdc42) activation, up","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",NS,NS,microglia,Neural / Glial,Microglia,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Neuroinflammation; Major depressive disorder,Autoimmune & Inflammatory; Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"neuroinflammation, down; depressive-like behaviors, down","Neuroinflammation, down; Depressive-like behavior, down",fasting; low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD),Fasting / Caloric restriction (endogenous); Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
29105987,The ketone body metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate induces an antidepression-associated ramification of microglia via HDACs inhibition-triggered Akt-small RhoGTPase activation.,"Direct induction of macrophage ramification has been shown to promote an alternative (M2) polarization, suggesting that the ramified morphology may determine the function of immune cells. The ketone body metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) elevated in conditions including fasting and low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) can reduce neuroinflammation. However, how exactly BHB impacts microglia remains unclear. We report that BHB as well as its producing stimuli fasting and KD induced obvious ramifications of murine microglia in basal and inflammatory conditions in a reversible manner, and these ramifications were accompanied with microglial profile toward M2 polarization and phagocytosis. The protein kinase B (Akt)-small RhoGTPase axis was found to mediate the effect of BHB on microglial shape change, as (i) BHB activated the microglial small RhoGTPase (Rac1, Cdc42) and Akt; (ii) Akt and Rac1-Cdc42 inhibition abolished the pro-ramification effect of BHB; (iii) Akt inhibition prevented the activation of Rac1-Cdc42 induced by BHB treatment. Incubation of microglia with other classical histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors, but not G protein-coupled receptor 109a (GPR109a) activators, also induced microglial ramification and Akt activation, suggesting that the BHB-induced ramification of microglia may be triggered by HDACs inhibition. Functionally, Akt inhibition was found to abrogate the effects of BHB on microglial polarization and phagocytosis. In neuroinflammatory models induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), BHB prevented the microglial process retraction and depressive-like behaviors, and these effects were abolished by Akt inhibition.

This study investigated the effects of an exogenous ketone ester (KE) on appetite. METHODS: Following an overnight fast, subjects with normal weight (n = 15) consumed 1.9 kcal/kg of KE, or isocaloric dextrose (DEXT), in drinks matched for volume, taste, tonicity, and color. Blood samples were analyzed for BHB, glucose, insulin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), and a three-measure visual analogue scale was used to measure hunger, fullness, and desire to eat. RESULTS: KE consumption increased blood BHB levels from 0.2 to 3.3 mM after 60 minutes. DEXT consumption increased plasma glucose levels between 30 and 60 minutes. Postprandial plasma insulin, ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY levels were significantly lower 2 to 4 hours after KE consumption, compared with DEXT consumption. Temporally related to the observed suppression of ghrelin, reported hunger and desire to eat were also significantly suppressed 1.5 hours after consumption of KE, compared with consumption of DEXT. CONCLUSIONS: Increased blood ketone levels may directly suppress appetite, as KE drinks lowered plasma ghrelin levels, perceived hunger, and desire to eat.",0,10 elite male cyclists,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"hyperketonemia, up",Metabolic Regulation,serum,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cycling time trial performance, down","Endurance capacity, down","1,3-butanediol acetoacetate diester",Multi-source,NS

In a randomized cross-over design, 10 elite male cyclists completed a ~31 km laboratory-based TT on a cycling ergometer programmed to simulate the 2017 World Road Cycling Championships course. Cyclists consumed a standardized meal [2 g/kg body mass (BM) carbohydrate (CHO)] the evening prior to a trial day and a CHO breakfast (2 g/kg BM CHO) with 200 mg caffeine on the morning of a trial day. Cyclists were randomized to consume either the ketone diester (2 x 250 mg/kg) or a placebo drink, followed immediately by 200 mL diet cola, given ~ 30 min before and immediately prior to commencing a 20 min incremental warm-up. Blood samples were collected prior to and during the warm-up, pre- and post- TT and at regular intervals after the TT. Urine samples were collected pre- and post- warm-up, immediately post TT and 60 min post TT. Pre-exercise ingestion of the diester resulted in a 2 +/- 1% impairment in TT performance that was associated with gut discomfort and higher perception of effort. Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, serum acetoacetate, and urine ketone concentrations increased from rest following ketone ingestion and were higher than placebo throughout the trial. Ketone ingestion induces hyperketonemia in elite professional cyclists when in a carbohydrate fed state, and impairs performance of a cycling TT lasting ~50 min.",0,healthy human volunteers; 15 participants; 16 participants; 12 participants; 4 participants,human,Human – Interventional; NS,"ketosis, up",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketone ester (KE): (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate; ketone salts (KS): sodium plus potassium betaHB,Ketone ester (KE); Ketone salt (KS),D-BHB
29187245,On the Metabolism of Exogenous Ketones in Humans.,"Background and aims: Currently there is considerable interest in ketone metabolism owing to recently reported benefits of ketosis for human health. Traditionally, ketosis has been achieved by following a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ""ketogenic"" diet, but adherence to such diets can be difficult. An alternative way to increase blood D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-betaHB) concentrations is ketone drinks, but the metabolic effects of exogenous ketones are relatively unknown. Here, healthy human volunteers took part in three randomized metabolic studies of drinks containing a ketone ester (KE); (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate, or ketone salts (KS); sodium plus potassium betaHB. Methods and Results: In the first study, 15 participants consumed KE or KS drinks that delivered ~12 or ~24 g of betaHB. Both drinks elevated blood D-betaHB concentrations (D-betaHB C(max): KE 2.8 mM, KS 1.0 mM, P < 0.001), which returned to baseline within 3-4 h. KS drinks were found to contain 50% of the L-betaHB isoform, which remained elevated in blood for over 8 h, but was not detectable after 24 h. Urinary excretion of both D-betaHB and L-betaHB was <1.5% of the total betaHB ingested and was in proportion to the blood AUC. D-betaHB, but not L-betaHB, was slowly converted to breath acetone. The KE drink decreased blood pH by 0.10 and the KS drink increased urinary pH from 5.7 to 8.5. In the second study, the effect of a meal before a KE drink on blood D-betaHB concentrations was determined in 16 participants. Food lowered blood D-betaHB C(max) by 33% (Fed 2.2 mM, Fasted 3.3 mM, P < 0.001), but did not alter acetoacetate or breath acetone concentrations. All ketone drinks lowered blood glucose, free fatty acid and triglyceride concentrations, and had similar effects on blood electrolytes, which remained normal. In the final study, participants were given KE over 9 h as three drinks (n = 12) or a continuous nasogastric infusion (n = 4) to maintain blood D-betaHB concentrations greater than 1 mM. Both drinks and infusions gave identical D-betaHB AUC of 1.3-1.4 moles.min. Conclusion: We conclude that exogenous ketone drinks are a practical, efficacious way to achieve ketosis.",0,pigs; pulmonary contusion; liver crush injury; hemorrhagic shock,animal,Animal – Other Mammal; NS,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Multi-disease,"survival, up","Survival, up",4 M BHB,In vitro media supplementation,D-BHB

Our objective was to find the most effective melatonin concentration in combination with 4 molar BHB (4 M BHB). Survival and markers of organ injury were analyzed in pigs exposed to pulmonary contusion, liver crush injury, and hemorrhagic shock and treated with lactated Ringer's solution; 4 M BHB/43 mM M; 4 M BHB/20 mM M; 4 M BHB/10 mM M; 4 M BHB/4.3 mM M; or 4 M BHB/0.43 mM M. This work is an extension of a previously published research study. RESULTS: Survival was highest in pigs receiving 4 M BHB/43 mM M (13/14), followed by lactated Ringer's solution (11/16) and BHB/M with decreased melatonin concentrations (4 M BHB/20 mM M 3/6, 4 M BHB/10 mM M 2/6, 4 M BHB/4.3 mM M 3/6, 4 M BHB/0.43 mM M 1/6, p = 0.011). High mortality was associated with increases in serum lactate, higher liver and muscle injury markers and decreases in PaO(2):FiO(2) ratios. Our study indicates that treatment with 4 M BHB and melatonin concentrations below 43 mM lack the survival benefit observed from 4 M BHB/43 mM melatonin in pigs experiencing hemorrhagic shock and polytrauma.",AQP4; HDAC3; MIR130A,U251 cells; 2 μM Abeta-treated U251 cells,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"miR-130a up, nan",Epigenetic Regulation,NS,NS,U251 cells,Neural / Glial,Astrocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"NS, nan","NS, nan",endogenous,NS,NS
29242353,Intermittent Fasting Protects against Alzheimer's Disease Possible through Restoring Aquaporin-4 Polarity.,"The impairment of amyloid-beta (Abeta) clearance in the brain plays a causative role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Polarity distribution of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is important to remove Abeta from brain. AQP4 polarity can be influenced by the ratio of two AQP4 isoforms M1 and M23 (AQP4-M1/M23), however, it is unknown whether the ratio of AQP4-M1/M23 changes in AD. Histone deacetylase 3 has been reported to be significantly increased in AD brain. Moreover, evidence indicated that microRNA-130a (miR-130a) possibly mediates the regulation of histone deacetylase 3 on AQP4-M1/M23 ratio by repressing the transcriptional activity of AQP4-M1 in AD. This study aimed to investigate whether intermittent fasting (IF), increasing the level of an endogenous histone deacetylases inhibitor beta-hydroxybutyrate, restores AQP4 polarity via miR-130a mediated reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio in protection against AD. The results showed that IF ameliorated cognitive dysfunction, prevented brain from Abeta deposition, and restored the AQP4 polarity in a mouse model of AD (APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice). Additionally, IF down-regulated the expression of AQP4-M1 and histone deacetylase 3, reduced AQP4-M1/M23 ratio, and increased miR-130a expression in the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 mice. In vitro, beta-hydroxybutyrate was found to down-regulate the expression of AQP4-M1 and histone deacetylase 3, reduce AQP4-M1/M23 ratio, and increase AQP4-M23 and miR-130a expression in 2 muM Abeta-treated U251 cells. Interestingly, on the contrary to the result observed in 2 muM Abeta-treated cells, AQP4 expression was obviously decreased in cells exposed to 10 muM Abeta. miR-130a mimic decreased the expression of AQP4-M1 and the ratio of AQP4-M1/M23, as well as silencing histone deacetylase 3 caused the up-regulation of AQP4 and miR-130a, and the reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio in U251 cells. In conclusion, IF exhibits beneficial effects against AD. The mechanism may be associated with recovery of AQP4 polarity, resulting from the reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate may partly mediate the effect of IF on the reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio in AD, in which miR-130a and histone deacetylase 3 may be implicated.",BDH1; 0,transverse aortic constriction; heart-specific Bdh1-overexpressing transgenic mice; isolated perfused hearts; adenovirus-mediated Bdh1 overexpression,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"ketone body oxidation, up",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Heart failure,Cardiovascular,"fibrosis, down; contractile dysfunction, down; oxidative damage, down; reactive oxygen species production, down; apoptosis, down","Fibrosis, down; Cardiac function, down; Oxidative stress, down; Apoptosis, down",[1-(14)C] beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

However, ketone body metabolism in the failing heart has not been fully investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microarray data analysis and mitochondrial isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification proteomics revealed that the expression of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase I (Bdh1), an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD(+)/NADH coupled interconversion of acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, was increased 2.5- and 2.8-fold, respectively, in the heart after transverse aortic constriction. In addition, ketone body oxidation was upregulated 2.2-fold in transverse aortic constriction hearts, as determined by the amount of (14)CO(2) released from the metabolism of [1-(14)C] beta-hydroxybutyrate in isolated perfused hearts. To investigate the significance of this augmented ketone body oxidation, we generated heart-specific Bdh1-overexpressing transgenic mice to recapitulate the observed increase in basal ketone body oxidation. Bdh1 transgenic mice showed a 1.7-fold increase in ketone body oxidation but did not exhibit any differences in other baseline characteristics. When subjected to transverse aortic constriction, Bdh1 transgenic mice were resistant to fibrosis, contractile dysfunction, and oxidative damage, as determined by the immunochemical detection of carbonylated proteins and histone acetylation. Upregulation of Bdh1 enhanced antioxidant enzyme expression. In our in vitro study, flow cytometry revealed that rotenone-induced reactive oxygen species production was decreased by adenovirus-mediated Bdh1 overexpression. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis was attenuated by Bdh1 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that ketone body oxidation increased in failing hearts, and increased ketone body utilization decreased oxidative stress and protected against heart failure.",0,rat model of hemorrhagic shock,animal,Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hemorrhagic shock,Injury & Trauma,"survival rate, nan; survival time, up","Survival, nan; Survival, up","d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and melatonin (MLT) in dimethyl sulfoxide - water; freeze-dried BHB-MLT formulation (intravenous, prepared with an aqueous vehicle)",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid); Intravenous BHB,D-BHB
29279425,Development and in vivo evaluation of a novel lyophilized formulation for the treatment of hemorrhagic shock.,"Hemorrhagic shock, caused by trauma, is a leading cause of preventable death. A combination treatment of d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and melatonin (MLT), in dimethyl sulfoxide - water, increased survival. A freeze-dried BHB-MLT formulation, with a short reconstitution time, has been developed. This intravenous formulation, prepared with an aqueous vehicle, completely eliminated dimethyl sulfoxide, thereby avoiding the potential problems associated with this solvent. The poor aqueous solubility of MLT necessitated the use of polyvinylpyrrolidine (PVP) as a complexing agent. Thus the prelyophilization solution contained BHB (2 M), MLT (21.5 mM) and PVP (40 mM). Using a combination of low-temperature X-ray diffractometry and thermal analysis, the lyophilization process parameters were optimized. Infra-red spectra revealed hydrogen bonding interaction between PVP and MLT, while BHB crystallized as BHB.0.25 H(2)O in the final lyophile. The formulation improved survival in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock. Based on the increase in rate of survival and longer survival time compared to untreated animals, we conclude that this formulation can serve as a promising first line of treatment for hemorrhagic shock.",0,NS,NS,NS,"modulation of histone modification reader/eraser proteins, NS",Epigenetic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"oxidative stress, down","Oxidative stress, down",endogenous metabolite,NS,D-BHB

Nineteen trained cyclists (12 male, 7 female) undertook graded exercise (8 min each at approximately 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80% VO(2peak)) on a cycle ergometer on two occasions separated by either 7 or 14 days. Trials included ingestion of boluses of either (i) plain water (3.8 mL kg body mass(-1)) (CON) or (ii) betaHB salts (0.38 g kg body mass(-1)) in plain water (3.8 mL kg body mass(-1)) (KET), at both 60 min and 15 min prior to exercise. During KET, plasma [betaHB] increased to 0.33 +/- 0.16 mM prior to exercise and 0.44 +/- 0.15 mM at the end of exercise (both p < .05). Plasma glucose was 0.44 +/- 0.27 mM lower (p < .01) 30 min after ingestion of KET and remained approximately 0.2 mM lower throughout exercise compared to CON (p < .001). Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was higher during KET compared to CON (p < .001) and 0.03-0.04 higher from 30%VO(2peak) to 60%VO(2peak) (all p < .05). No differences in plasma lactate, rate of perceived exertion, or gross or delta efficiency were observed between trials. Gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in 13 out of 19 participants during KET. Acute ingestion of betaHB salts induces nutritional ketosis and alters the metabolic response to exercise in trained cyclists. Elevated RER during KET may be indicative of increased ketone body oxidation during exercise, but at the plasma betaHB concentrations achieved, ingestion of betaHB salts does not affect lactate appearance, perceived exertion, or muscular efficiency.",LPL; MIR29A; HDAC2; HDAC3; 0,APP/PS1 mice; SH-SY5Y cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"microRNA-29a down-regulation, down",Epigenetic Regulation,cerebral cortex,Brain/CNS,SH-SY5Y cells,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
29446830,Intermittent Fasting Alleviates the Increase of Lipoprotein Lipase Expression in Brain of a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease: Possibly Mediated by beta-hydroxybutyrate.,"Intermittent fasting has been demonstrated to protect against Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the mechanism is unclear. Histone acetylation and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) are involved in AD progression. Importantly, LPL has been documented to be regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors (increase histone acetylation level) in adipocyte and mesenchymal stem cells, or by fasting in adipose and muscle tissues. In brain, however, whether histone acetylation or fasting regulates LPL expression is unknown. This study was designed to demonstrate intermittent fasting may protect against AD through increasing beta-hydroxybutyrate, a HDACs inhibitor, to regulate LPL. We also investigated microRNA-29a expression associating with regulation of LPL and histone acetylation. The results showed LPL mRNA expression was increased and microRNA-29a expression was decreased in the cerebral cortex of AD model mice (APP/PS1), which were alleviated by intermittent fasting. No significant differences were found in the total expression of LPL protein (brain-derived and located in capillary endothelial cells from peripheral tissues) in the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 mice. Further study indicated that LPL located in capillary endothelial cells was decreased in the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 mice, which was alleviated by intermittent fasting. LPL and microRNA-29a expression were separately increased and down-regulated in 2 muM Abeta(25-35)-exposed SH-SY5Y cells, but respectively decreased and up-regulated in 10 muM Abeta(25-35)-exposed cells, which were all reversed by beta-hydroxybutyrate. The increase of HDAC2/3 expression and the decrease of acetylated H3K9 and H4K12 levels were alleviated in APP/PS1 mice by intermittent fasting treatment, as well in 2 or 10 muM Abeta(25-35)-exposed cells by beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment. These findings above suggested the results from APP/PS1 mice were consistent with those from cells treated with 2 muM Abeta(25-35). Interestingly, LPL expression was reduced (0.2-folds) and microRNA-29a expression was up-regulated (1.7-folds) in HDAC2-silenced cells, but respectively increased (1.3-folds) and down-regulated (0.8-folds) in HDAC3-silenced cells. Furthermore, LPL expression was decreased in cells treated with microRNA-29a mimic and increased with inhibitor treatment. In conclusion, intermittent fasting inhibits the increase of brain-derived LPL expression in APP/PS1 mice partly through beta-hydroxybutyrate-mediated down-regulation of microRNA-29a expression. HDAC2/3 may be implicated in the effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate on microRNA-29a expression.",BDH1; 0; INS,healthy participants (n = 20; 10 males/10 females; aged 18-35),human,Human – Interventional; NS,"insulin sensitivity, up",Metabolic Regulation,plasma,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"glycaemic response, down","Glycemic control, down",(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate ketone monoester (DeltaG(R); TDeltaS Ltd),Ketone ester (KE); NS,D-BHB

In the present study, we determined the effect of (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate ketone monoester on the glycaemic response and insulin sensitivity index during a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in humans. The results obtained show that consuming a ketone monoester supplement 30 min prior to an OGTT reduced the glycaemic response and markers of insulin sensitivity without affecting insulin secretion. The findings of the present study provides evidence that ketone supplements could have therapeutic potential for future application as a glucose-lowering nutritional supplement. ABSTRACT: The main objectives of the present study were: (i) to determine whether acute ingestion of ketone monoester (K(me) ); (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate impacts plasma glucose levels during a standardized oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and (ii) to compare changes in insulin concentrations and estimates of insulin sensitivity after acute K(me) supplementation. Twenty healthy participants (n = 10 males/females) aged between 18 and 35 years took part in a randomized cross-over study. After an overnight fast, participants consumed a K(me) supplement (DeltaG(R); TDeltaS Ltd, UK, Oxford, UK; 0.45 ml kg(-1) body weight) or placebo (water) 30 min before completing a 75 g OGTT. Blood samples were collected every 15-30 min over 2.5 h. The participants and study personnel performing the laboratory analyses were blinded to the study condition. K(me) acutely raised blood d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) to 3.2 +/- 0.6 mm within 30 min with levels remaining elevated throughout the entire OGTT. Compared to placebo, K(me) significantly decreased the glucose area under the curve (AUC; -17%, P = 0.001), non-esterified fatty acid AUC (-44%, P < 0.001) and C-peptide incremental AUC (P = 0.005), at the same time as improving oral glucose insulin sensitivity index by approximately 11% (P = 0.001). In conclusion, a K(me) supplement that acutely increased beta-OHB levels up to approximately 3 mm attenuated the glycaemic response to an OGTT in healthy humans. The reduction in glycaemic response did not appear to be driven by an increase in insulin secretion, although it was accompanied by improved markers of insulin sensitivity. These results suggest that ketone monoester supplements could have therapeutic potential in the management and prevention of metabolic diseases.",0,"15 healthy, college-aged males",human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"betaHB levels, up",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) containing beverage,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

Fifteen healthy, college-aged males (mean +/- SD; age: 23.1 +/- 2.4 years, height: 165.4 +/- 2.0 cm, mass: 81.4 +/- 9.2 kg) volunteered for the present study. Trial 1 consisted of baseline measures and familiarization for the protocol. During trials 2 and 3, subjects reported to the laboratory, after a 10-h fast, and ingested 11.38 g of betaHB or a placebo (PLA) beverage 30 min before exercise. Participants then completed a cognitive challenge (CC), consisting of a 5-min FitLight response task while cycling. At the cessation of the test, participants then completed four 15-s repeated Wingates with 4 min of rest between, followed by another 5-min CC response task. Blood ketones, glucose, and lactate were measured pre-CC and post-Wingates. betaHB levels were significantly higher compared with PLA (0.53 vs. 0.21 mmol/L), respectively. A significant order effect was observed across trials 2 and 3 for total FitLight misses and hits, regardless of treatment. Further, there were no significant differences among Wingate power output between treatments, although fatigue index was higher in the betaHB group compared with PLA (32.3 vs. 29.4 W/s), respectively.

This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective efficacy of exogenous BHB administration in a suckling rat model after hypoxia-ischemia (HI). Thirteen-day-old (P13) rat pups were subjected to 120 min of hypoxia according to the Rice-Vannucci model. BHB (5.0 mmol/kg, HI-BHB) or vehicle (0.9% saline, HI-Veh) was administered 0, 2, 4, and 6 h after HI induction. Pathologic injury scores and the number of TUNEL-positive cells were evaluated on P15. Residual hemispheric volume was measured with T2-weighted MRI (on P27) and functional tests, such as the negative geotaxis test, rope suspension test, rotarod test, novel object recognition test, and cylinder test, were performed. Systemic ketosis (approx. 2.0-3.0 mM/L) was well tolerated by the rat pups with no difference in the mortality rate between both groups. Compared with the HI-Veh group, the HI-BHB group demonstrated significantly lower pathological scores as well as fewer TUNEL-positive cells. The intact residual hemispheric and hippocampal volumes were greater in the HI-BHB group than the HI-Veh group. However, the results of functional tests did not differ between both groups.

We examined the physiological stress response to air exposure in Atlantic stingrays (Hypanus sabinus) using a serial sampling method requiring minimal handling. Many elasmobranch stress studies exclusively quantify glucose, although there is evidence that elasmobranchs are unusually reliant on ketone bodies. Therefore, we also tested the hypothesis that ketone bodies play a significant role in the elasmobranch stress response by examining plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate. Plasma osmolality, urea, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and a suite of ions were also measured to characterize departures from homeostasis due to air exposure. H. sabinus were exposed to air for 30 min and serially sampled at 0, 15, and 30 min, as well as 48 h after the stressor to assess the extent of recovery. Blood lactate and acidosis increased significantly during the stressor and returned to basal levels by 48 h. Glucose values were significantly affected, with the highest values observed at 48 h, suggesting that animals were not fully recovered as initially indicated by other metrics. Average plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate was unaffected by the stressor. This suggests that ketone bodies may not be a major fuel source used during acute stress, at least in the timeframe examined.",0,Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"A(1)R-mediated adenosinergic signaling, decreased",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Anxiety disorder,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"anxiety level, decreased","Anxiety-like behavior, decreased",KSMCT (ketone salt/KS + medium chain triglyceride/MCT oil),Multi-source,NS

To investigate the potential role of the adenosinergic system in the pathomechanism of anxiety we tested whether the inhibition of adenosine A(1) receptors (A(1)Rs) influence the anxiolytic effect of the exogenous ketone supplement. As A(1)Rs may mediate such an effect, in the present study we used a specific A(1)R antagonist, DPCPX (1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine) to test whether it modulates the anxiolytic effect of sub-chronically (7 days) applied KSMCT in the previously tested animal model by using elevated plus maze (EPM) test. We administered KSMCT (2.5 g/kg/day) alone by intragastric gavage and in combination with intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected of DPCPX in two doses (lower: 0.15 mg/kg, higher: 0.25 mg/kg). Control groups represented i.p saline and water gavage with or without i.p. DPCPX administration (2.5 g/kg/day). After treatments, the level of blood glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), as well as body weight were recorded. KSMCT alone significantly increased the time spent in the open arms and decreased the time spent in the closed arms, supporting our previous results. Injection of lower dose of DPCPX decreased, while higher dose of DPCPX abolished the effect of KSMCT administration on EPM. Blood betaHB levels were significantly increased after administration of KSMCT, while DPCPX did not change the KSMCT induced increase in blood betaHB levels. These results demonstrate that A(1)R inhibition modified (decreased) the anti-anxiety effect of KSMCT administration implying that the adenosinergic system, likely via A(1)Rs, may modulate the exogenous ketone supplement induced anxiolytic influence.",0,38 schizophrenia patients; 38 healthy controls,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"protective role in executive function, positive",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Schizophrenia,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"executive function, positive","Cognition, positive",NS,NS,NS

In this prospective study, we aim to investigate the trends of beta-HB and pyruvate levels, metabolic changes, and cognitive function in schizophrenia patients receiving antipsychotic treatment. OBJECTIVE: We recruited 38 schizophrenia patients who had been treated with antipsychotics for 12 weeks, as well as 38 healthy age- and gender-matched subjects. Blood samples were taken from the patients at baseline and week 12 to determine the serum levels of beta-HB, pyruvate, and metabolic parameters, while blood samples of the healthy controls were taken at baseline. We evaluated the psychopathology using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and cognitive function using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia. RESULTS: During the 12-week follow-up period, the beta-HB levels in patients with schizophrenia showed a decreasing trend, particularly in those undergoing treatment with aripiprazole or ziprasidone. The serum levels of beta-HB in patients at baseline and week 12 were both higher than the levels in the healthy controls. Among the schizophrenia patients, changes in beta-HB were positively correlated with changes in executive function. On the other hand, serum pyruvate levels remained steady during the 12-week follow-up period, and we found no significant correlation between pyruvate changes and changes in cognitive function or clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that beta-HB may possess a potential indicator of energy utilization and have a protective role in executive function in patients with schizophrenia. Additional longitudinal studies with a larger sample size and longer follow-up periods are necessary to identify the relationship of metabolite regulation and cognitive function during schizophrenia patients' exposure to antipsychotics.",0,castrated male sheep,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"gene expression, NS",Other / Unspecified,hypothalamus; pituitary,Brain/CNS; Pituitary,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan","beta-hydroxybutyric acid sodium salt solution (BHB; 12,800 micromol/l)",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid); NS,NS
29649104,Beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion identifies acutely differentially expressed genes related to metabolism and reproduction in the hypothalamus and pituitary of castrated male sheep.,"To identify molecular pathways that couple metabolic imbalances and reproduction, we randomly assigned 10 castrated male sheep to be centrally injected into the lateral ventricle through intracerebroventricular cannulas with 1 ml of beta-hydroxybutyric acid sodium salt solution (BHB; 12,800 micromol/l) or saline solution (CON; 0.9% NaCl). Approximately 2 h postinjection, sheep were humanely euthanized, and hypothalamus and pituitary tissues were harvested for transcriptome characterization by RNA sequencing. RNA was extracted from the hypothalamus and pituitary and sequenced at a high depth (hypothalamus: 468,912,732 reads; pituitary: 515,106,092 reads) with the Illumina Hi-Seq 2500 platform and aligned to Bos taurus and Ovis aries genomes. Of the total raw reads, 87% (hypothalamus) and 90.5% (pituitary) mapped to the reference O. aries genome. Within these read sets, ~56% in hypothalamus and 69% in pituitary mapped to either known or putative protein coding genes. Fragments per kilobase of transcripts per million normalized counts were averaged and ranked to identify the transcript expression level. Gene Ontology analysis (DAVID Bioinformatics Resources) was utilized to identify biological process functions related to genes shared between tissues, as well as functional categories with tissue-specific enrichment. Between CON- and BHB-treated sheep, 11 and 44 genes were differentially expressed (adj. P < 0.05) within the pituitary and hypothalamus, respectively. Functional enrichment analyses revealed BHB altered expression of genes in pathways related to stimulus perception, inflammation, and cell cycle control. The set of genes altered by BHB creates a foundation from which to identify the signaling pathways that impact reproduction during metabolic imbalances.",SLC2A2; MAFA; NEUROD1,aged rats; primary human islets,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells,"mitochondrial function, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,primary human islets,Pancreas,beta-cells,Pancreatic Endocrine,β-cells (islet),mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"beta-cell function, up","Insulin secretion, up",chronic treatment,NS,NS
29662437,Coordination of GPR40 and Ketogenesis Signaling by Medium Chain Fatty Acids Regulates Beta Cell Function.,"Diabetes prevalence increases with age, and beta-cell dysfunction contributes to the incidence of the disease. Dietary lipids have been recognized as contributory factors in the development and progression of the disease. Unlike long chain triglycerides, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) increase fat burning in animal and human subjects as well as serum C-peptide in type 2 diabetes patients. We evaluated the beneficial effects of MCT on beta-cells in vivo and in vitro. MCT improved glycemia in aged rats via beta-cell function assessed by measuring insulin secretion and content. In beta-cells, medium chain fatty acid (MCFA)-C10 activated fatty acid receptor 1 FFAR1/GPR40, while MCFA-C8 induced mitochondrial ketogenesis and the C8:C10 mixture improved beta cell function. We showed that GPR40 signaling positively impacts ketone body production in beta-cells, and chronic treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) improves beta-cell function. We also showed that BHB and MCFA help beta-cells recover from lipotoxic stress by improving mitochondrial function and increasing the expression of genes involved in beta-cell function and insulin biogenesis, such as Glut2, MafA, and NeuroD1 in primary human islets. MCFA offers a therapeutic advantage in the preservation of beta-cell function as part of a preventative strategy against diabetes in at risk populations.",NLRP3; TXNIP; DNM1L,mice; SH-SY-5Y cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"ER stress, down",General Stress Responses,brain,Brain/CNS,SH-SY-5Y cells,Unspecified / Mixed,Cell line (origin unclear),mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Ischemic stroke,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"tolerance to MCAO/R, up","Ischemia-reperfusion injury severity, up",KD; BHB (10 mM),Ketogenic diet (endogenous); In vitro media supplementation,NS

This study aimed to investigate the effects of KD on NLRP3 inflammasome and explore the potential molecular mechanisms. Methods: In in vivo study, mice were fed with KD for 3 weeks and then subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R)-injury. In in vitro study, SH-SY-5Y cells were treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) followed by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). NLRP3 inflammasome activation and related regulatory mechanisms were evaluated. Results: Mice fed with KD had increased tolerance to MCAO/R. KD inhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and suppressed TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the brain. The in vitro study showed BHB (10 mM) prevented the mitochondrial translocation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) to inhibit mitochondrial fission. Furthermore, BHB decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, inhibited ROS-NLRP3 pathway in OGD/R-treated cells, and suppressed ER stress-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Conclusions: KD may suppress ER stress and protect mitochondrial integrity by suppressing the mitochondrial translocation of Drp1 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thus exerting neuroprotective effects.

Male adult mice were exposed to 30 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Osmotic pumps were implanted subcutaneously 5 min before reperfusion for continuous delivery of the exogenous BHB (1.6 mmol/kg/24 h). Treatment with BHB reduced infarct size and levels of cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in serum, attenuated apoptosis in myocardium, and preserved cardiac function of I/R mice. Importantly, treatment of I/R mice with BHB promoted autophagic flux, evidenced by reduced the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and protein expression of p62 and enhanced protein expression of lysosome associated membrane protein-2 (Lamp2) in myocardium. Treatment of I/R mice with BHB reduced mitochondrial formation of reactive oxygen species, enhanced adenosine triphosphate production, attenuated mitochondrial swelling, and partly restored mitochondrial membrane potential in myocardium. Furthermore, treatment of I/R mice with BHB abated oxidative stress and attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress in myocardium.

29730171,beta-Hydroxybutyrate protects from alcohol-induced liver injury via a Hcar2-cAMP dependent pathway.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sterile inflammation resulting in alcoholic hepatitis (AH) occurs unpredictably after many years of excess alcohol intake. The factors responsible for the development of AH are not known but mitochondrial damage with loss of mitochondrial function are common features. Hcar2 is a G-protein coupled receptor which is activated by beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). We aimed to determine the relevance of the BHB-Hcar2 pathway in alcoholic liver disease. METHODS: We tested if loss of BHB production can result in increased liver inflammation. We further tested if BHB supplementation is protective in AH through interaction with Hcar2, and analyzed the immune and cellular basis for protection. RESULTS: Humans with AH have reduced hepatic BHB, and inhibition of BHB production in mice aggravated ethanol-induced AH, with higher plasma alanine aminotransferase levels, increased steatosis and greater neutrophil influx. Conversely supplementation of BHB had the opposite effects with reduced alanine aminotransferase levels, reduced steatosis and neutrophil influx. This therapeutic effect of BHB is dependent on the receptor Hcar2. BHB treatment increased liver Il10 transcripts, and promoted the M2 phenotype of intrahepatic macrophages. BHB also increased the transcriptional level of M2 related genes in vitro bone marrow derived macrophages. This skewing towards M2 related genes is dependent on lower mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi) induced by BHB. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data shows that BHB production during excess alcohol consumption has an anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective role through an Hcar2 dependent pathway. This introduces the concept of metabolite-based therapy for AH. LAY SUMMARY: Alcoholic hepatitis is a life-threatening condition with no approved therapy that occurs unexpectedly in people who consume excess alcohol. The liver makes many metabolites, and we demonstrate that loss of one such metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate occurs in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. This loss can increase alcohol-induced liver injury, and beta-hydroxybutyrate can protect from alcohol-induced liver injury via a receptor on liver macrophages. This opens the possibility of metabolite-based therapy for alcoholic hepatitis.",0,middle temporal gyrus slices from two male children (26 months; 35 months); 0-Mg2+/high-K+ in vitro epilepsy model; propionate model,human; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS; In vitro – Primary cells,"intracellular pH reduction, down",Ion & Nutrient Transport,neocortex,Brain/CNS,cortical neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"epileptiform discharge frequency, down; epileptiform discharge duration, up","Seizure activity, down; Seizure activity, up",DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (10 mM),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

Yet, there have been no respective data about humans. Thus, we investigated the interrelation of pHi and excitability of human cortical neurons. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intracellular electrophysiological and pH-recordings were made in neurons in slices taken from brain tissue resected from the middle temporal gyrus of two male children (26 months and 35 months old) who suffered from pharmacotherapy-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. To excite the tissue (n = 13), we used the 0-Mg2+/high-K+-in vitro epilepsy model producing robust epileptiform discharges (ED). To evoke an intracellular acidification (n = 12), we used the well-established propionate-model and applied 10 mM propionate to the bath solutions. In addition, we recorded the effects of other strongly related short-chain monocarboxylates (l-lactate (10 mM) and the ketone body DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (10 mM)) on ED and pHi. KEY FINDINGS: The ED-frequency was reversibly reduced by propionate (n = 5), l-lactate (n = 5), or DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (n = 3), while the durations of EDs and their after-depolarizations increased. In parallel experiments, all three short-chain monocarboxylates (each n = 4) lowered the pHi of the neurons (n = 12) by 0.05-0.07 pH units which was temporally related to the reported changes in bioelectric activity. SIGNIFICANCE: A mild drop of the intraneuronal pH was associated with the control of even over-excited human neocortical tissue. This is identical with prior observations in non-human mammalian cortical neurons.

29771336,Direct neurotransmitter activation of voltage-gated potassium channels.,"Voltage-gated potassium channels KCNQ2-5 generate the M-current, which controls neuronal excitability. KCNQ2-5 subunits each harbor a high-affinity anticonvulsant drug-binding pocket containing an essential tryptophan (W265 in human KCNQ3) conserved for >500 million years, yet lacking a known physiological function. Here, phylogenetic analysis, electrostatic potential mapping, in silico docking, electrophysiology, and radioligand binding assays reveal that the anticonvulsant binding pocket evolved to accommodate endogenous neurotransmitters including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which directly activates KCNQ5 and KCNQ3 via W265. GABA, and endogenous metabolites beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) and gamma-amino-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (GABOB), competitively and differentially shift the voltage dependence of KCNQ3 activation. Our results uncover a novel paradigm: direct neurotransmitter activation of voltage-gated ion channels, enabling chemosensing of the neurotransmitter/metabolite landscape to regulate channel activity and cellular excitability.",FTO,mouse hypothalamus; cultured cells; FTOI367F mice; high-fat diet-induced obese mice; 48-h fasting mice,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells,"promoter occupancy by FTO, up",Epigenetic Regulation,hypothalamus,Brain/CNS,cultured cells,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketogenic diet-derived ketone body,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
29808353,FTO is a transcriptional repressor to auto-regulate its own gene and potentially associated with homeostasis of body weight.,"Fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) protein is a ferrous ion (Fe2+)/2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent demethylase preferentially catalyzing m6A sites in RNA. The FTO gene is highly expressed in the hypothalamus with fluctuation in response to various nutritional conditions, which is believed to be involved in the control of whole body metabolism. However, the underlying mechanism in response to different nutritional cues remains poorly understood. Here we show that ketogenic diet-derived ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) transiently increases FTO expression in both mouse hypothalamus and cultured cells. Interestingly, the FTO protein represses Fto promoter activity, which can be offset by BHB. We then demonstrate that FTO binds to its own gene promoter, and Fe2+, but not 2-OG, impedes this binding and increases FTO expression. The BHB-induced occupancy of the promoter by FTO influences the assembly of the basal transcriptional machinery. Importantly, a loss-of-function FTO mutant (I367F), which induces a lean phenotype in FTOI367F mice, exhibits augmented binding and elevated potency to repress the promoter. Furthermore, FTO fails to bind to its own promoter that promotes FTO expression in the hypothalamus of high-fat diet-induced obese and 48-h fasting mice, suggesting a disruption of the stable expression of this gene. Taken together, this study uncovers a new function of FTO as a Fe2+-sensitive transcriptional repressor dictating its own gene switch to form an auto-regulatory loop that may link with the hypothalamic control of body weight.",0,rat hippocampal organotypic slice cultures,in vitro,Multi-model,"gamma oscillation frequency, up",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",partial substitution of glucose with pyruvate and the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
29850235,Metabolic modulation of neuronal gamma-band oscillations.,"Gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) represent a physiological fast brain rhythm that occurs in many cortex areas in awake mammals, including humans. They associate with sensory perception, voluntary movement, and memory formation and require precise synaptic transmission between excitatory glutamatergic neurons and inhibitory GABAergic interneurons such as parvalbumin-positive basket cells. Notably, gamma oscillations are exquisitely sensitive to shortage in glucose and oxygen supply (metabolic stress), with devastating consequences for higher cognitive functions. Herein, we explored the robustness of gamma oscillations against changes in the availability of alternative energy substrates and amino acids, which is partially regulated by glial cells such as astrocytes. We used organotypic slice cultures of the rat hippocampus expressing acetylcholine-induced persistent gamma oscillations under normoxic recording conditions (20% oxygen fraction). Our main findings are (1) partial substitution of glucose with pyruvate and the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate increases the frequency of gamma oscillations, even at different stages of neuronal tissue development. (2) Supplementation with the astrocytic neurotransmitter precursor glutamine has no effect on the properties of gamma oscillations. (3) Supplementation with glycine increases power, frequency, and inner coherence of gamma oscillations in a dose-dependent manner. (4) During these treatments switches to other frequency bands or pathological network states such as neural burst firing or synchronized epileptic activity are absent. Our study indicates that cholinergic gamma oscillations show general robustness against these changes in nutrient and amino acid composition of the cerebrospinal fluid; however, modulation of their properties may impact on cortical information processing under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.",0,six healthy subjects,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"D-betaHB concentration, up",Metabolic Regulation,serum,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"gastrointestinal symptoms, up","Gastrointestinal symptoms, up",mixture of sodium and calcium D-/L-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic
29852870,Effect of a Sodium and Calcium DL-beta-Hydroxybutyrate Salt in Healthy Adults.,"BACKGROUND: Ketone body therapy and supplementation are of high interest for several medical and nutritional fields. The intake of ketone bodies is often discussed in relation to rare metabolic diseases, such as multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), that have no alternatives for treatment. Case reports showed positive results of therapy using ketone bodies. The number of ketone body salts offered on the wellness market is increasing steadily. More information on the kinetics of intake, safety, and tolerance of these products is needed. METHODS: In a one-dose kinetic study, six healthy subjects received an intervention (0.5 g/kg bw) using a commercially available ketone body supplement. The supplement contained a mixture of sodium and calcium D-/L-beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) as well as food additives. The blood samples drawn in the study were tested for concentrations of D-betaHB, glucose, and electrolytes, and blood gas analyses were done. Data on sensory evaluation and observed side effects of the supplement were collected. The product also went through chemical food analysis. RESULTS: The supplement led to a significant increase of D-betaHB concentration in blood 2.5 and 3 h after oral intake (p=0.033; p=0.043). The first significant effect was measured after 2 h with a mean value of 0.598 +/- 0.300 mmol/L at the peak, which was recorded at 2.5 h. Changes in serum electrolytes and BGA were largely unremarkable. Taking the supplement was not without side effects. One subject dropped out due to gastrointestinal symptoms and two others reported similar but milder problems. CONCLUSIONS: Intake of a combination of calcium and sodium D-/L-betaHB salt shows a slow resorption with a moderate increase of D-betaHB in serum levels. An influence of betaHB salts on acid-base balance could not be excluded by this one-dose study. Excessive regular consumption without medical observation is not free of adverse effects.

29904341,Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Donepezil Effects on Plasma beta-Hydroxybutyrate Levels in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a multi-factorial etiology that is not completely understood. Donepezil is a first-line acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used for the treatment of AD that has been found, in addition to its potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effect, to act through other non-cholinergic mechanisms such as affecting mitochondrial biogenesis through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC1alpha). Mitochondrial biogenesis and PGC-1alpha, at least in part, are associated with hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. Whether donepezil regulates ketogenesis in AD treatment remains unclear. Ketogenesis is important in the progression of AD and is a critical consideration during the therapeutic strategy selection for AD. Thus, our goals were to determine the differences in ketone bodies in patients with AD who were taking donepezil treatment and those who were not, to elucidate the potential effect of AD and donepezil therapy on ketone body metabolic parameters, and to discover the effect of donepezil therapy on ketogenesis in patients with AD. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis was performed on plasma collected from 145 individuals, namely, elderly adults as healthy controls (n=30), newly diagnosed patients with AD (n=30), patients with AD who responded to donepezil therapy (n=48) and patients with AD who did not respond to donepezil therapy (n=37). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed to quantify the lipids in the plasma. The level of beta-hydroxybutyrate, a metabolite, was determined by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry, and to gain further insight into the effect of donepezil on ketogenesis, the effects of donepezil were investigated in a mouse model. RESULTS: The level of beta-hydroxybutyrate decreased in AD patients, and donepezil elevated the plasma level of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Donepezil increased the plasma and liver levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate in mice as well as the hepatic expression of PGC-1alpha and the mitochondrial expression of HMG-CoA synthetase 2 (HMGCS2) in response to fasting, causing a subsequent increase in ketogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that impaired ketogenesis is a metabolic feature of AD. Donepezil had effects on ketogenesis in mice and reversed the decrease in the level of beta-hydroxybutyrate found in patients with AD.",0,Drosophila TDP-43 model; TDP(WT); TDP(G298S),animal,Animal – Invertebrate; NS,"bypassing the carnitine shuttle deficit, positive",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,motor neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,Neurodegenerative,"locomotor function, up","Locomotor activity, up",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Although evidence that metabolism is altered in ALS is compelling, the mechanisms underlying metabolic dysregulation and the contribution of altered metabolic pathways to disease remain poorly understood. Here we use a Drosophila model of ALS based on TDP-43 that recapitulates hallmark features of the disease including locomotor dysfunction and reduced lifespan. We performed a global, unbiased metabolomic profiling of larvae expressing TDP-43 (wild-type, TDP(WT) or disease-associated mutant, TDP(G298S)) and identified several lipid metabolism associated alterations. Among these, we found a significant increase in carnitine conjugated long-chain fatty acids and a significant decrease in carnitine, acetyl-carnitine and beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone precursor. Taken together these data suggest a deficit in the function of the carnitine shuttle and reduced lipid beta oxidation. To test this possibility we used a combined genetic and dietary approach in Drosophila. Our findings indicate that components of the carnitine shuttle are misexpressed in the context of TDP-43 proteinopathy and that genetic modulation of CPT1 or CPT2 expression, two core components of the carnitine shuttle, mitigates TDP-43 dependent locomotor dysfunction, in a variant dependent manner. In addition, feeding medium-chain fatty acids or beta-hydroxybutyrate improves locomotor function, consistent with the notion that bypassing the carnitine shuttle deficit is neuroprotective. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential contribution of the carnitine shuttle and lipid beta oxidation in ALS and suggest strategies for therapeutic intervention based on restoring lipid metabolism in motor neurons.",0,lethal rat hemorrhagic shock model,animal,Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hemorrhagic shock,Injury & Trauma,"survival, up","Survival, up",d-beta-hydroxybutyrate and melatonin (BHB/MLT) infusion; BHB/MLT/DMSO; BHB/MLT/PVP; BHB/MLT/CD,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid); Multi-source,D-BHB

BHB/MLT/DMSO was given at full strength and 1:1 dilution to match the concentration of the novel formulations. Rats were anesthetized, instrumented, and 40% of the total blood volume was withdrawn in three steps, followed by four-hour long shock. Treatment boluses were infused half-way throughout hemorrhage.

Heart rate, RPE, and 15-m sprint times were recorded throughout, and serial venous blood samples were assayed for plasma glucose, lactate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. RESULTS: KE resulted in plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations of ~1.5 to 2.6 mM during exercise (P < 0.001). Plasma glucose and lactate concentrations were lower during KE compared with PLA (moderate-to-large effect sizes). Heart rate, RPE, and 15-m sprint times did not differ between trials. Run time to exhaustion was not different (P = 0.126, d = 0.45) between PLA (mean = 268 s, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 199-336 s) and KE (mean = 229 s, 95% CI = 178-280 s). Incorrect responses in a multitasking test increased from pre- to postexercise in PLA (mean = 1.8, 95% CI = -0.6 to 4.1) but not in KE (mean = 0.0, 95% CI = -1.8 to 1.8) (P = 0.017, d = 0.70). CONCLUSION: Compared with carbohydrate alone, coingestion of a KE by team sport athletes attenuated the rise in plasma lactate concentrations but did not improve shuttle run time to exhaustion or 15-m sprint times during intermittent running. An attenuation of the decline in executive function after exhausting exercise suggests a cognitive benefit after KE ingestion.",0,apparently healthy non-aerobically trained participants (n=10),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"blood BHB concentration, up",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"walking economy, no-change; VO2, no-change; RER, no-change; energy expenditure, no-change; rating of perceived exertion, no-change","Exercise capacity, no-change; VO2max, no-change; Respiratory exchange ratio (RER), no-change; Energy expenditure, no-change",1 ounce of an exogenous BHB solution (KETO),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

In a repeated-measures, crossover design, ten non-aerobically trained participants (three males; seven females) performed two stages of a duration-modified Bruce treadmill protocol. Participants blindly consumed either 1 ounce of an exogenous BHB solution (KETO) or a noncaloric placebo (CON) 30 minutes prior to exercise testing. Blood ketone and glucose concentrations were measured prior to supplementation (baseline), immediately before exercise, and after exercise. Oxygen consumption (VO(2)), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), energy expenditure (EE), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded during the last two minutes of each stage. Blood BHB concentrations were significantly elevated at the pre-exercise and postexercise time points as compared to the CON condition (p < .001), and blood glucose was significantly elevated postexercise in both conditions as compared to baseline levels (p < .001). No significant between-trial differences (p > .05) were found for VO(2), RER, EE, or RPE.

30021521,Beta-hydroxybutyrate Promotes the Expression of BDNF in Hippocampal Neurons under Adequate Glucose Supply.,"Neurobiological evidence suggests that the ketone metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) exerts many neuroprotective functions for the brain. The previous study revealed that BHBA could promote the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at glucose inadequate condition. Here we demonstrated that BHBA administration induced the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of mice fed with normal diet. In vitro experiment results also showed that 0.02-2 mM BHBA significantly increased BDNF expression in both the primary hippocampal neurons and the hippocampus neuron cell line HT22 under adequate glucose supply. Bdnf transcription induced by BHBA stimulus was mediated through the cAMP/PKA-triggered phosphorylation of CREB (S133) and the subsequent up-regulation of histone H3 Lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) binding at Bdnf promoters I, II, IV, and VI. Moreover, BHBA stimulus induced a decrease in tri-methylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) binding at the Bdnf promoters II and VI and the elevation of H3K27me3-specific demethylase JMJD3, which also contributed to the activation of Bdnf transcription. These results demonstrated that BHBA within the physiological range could promote BDNF expression in neurons via a novel signaling function. Moreover, BHBA might possess more broad epigenetic regulatory activities, which affected both the acetylation and demethylation of H3K27. Our findings reinforce the beneficial effect of BHBA on the central nervous system (CNS) and suggest that BHBA administration with no need for energy restriction might also be a promising intervention to improve the neuronal activity and ameliorate the degeneration of CNS.",0,GLUT1 deficiency (G1D) syndrome mice; Sprague-Dawley (SPD) rats; Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats,animal,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Rat,"blood ketone levels, up",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"onset of isoflurane-induced immobility, delayed","Seizure activity, delayed","ketogenic diet (KD); ketone salt supplement (KS); ketone ester supplement (KE; 1,3 butanediol-acetoacetate diester)",Ketogenic diet (endogenous); Ketone salt (KS); Ketone ester (KE); Multi-source,NS
30027365,Nutritional ketosis delays the onset of isoflurane induced anesthesia.,"BACKGROUND: Ketogenic diet (KD) and exogenous ketone supplements can evoke sustained ketosis, which may modulate sleep and sleep-like effects. However, no studies have been published examining the effect of ketosis on the onset of general isoflurane induced anesthesia. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the KD and different exogenous ketogenic supplements on the onset of akinesia induced by inhalation of isoflurane. METHODS: We used a high fat, medium protein and low carbohydrate diet (KD) chronically (10 weeks) in the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) deficiency (G1D) syndrome mice model and sub-chronically (7 days) in Sprague-Dawley (SPD) rats. To investigate the effect of exogenous ketone supplements on anesthetic induction we also provided either 1) a standard rodent chow diet (SD) mixed with 20% ketone salt supplement (KS), or 2) SD mixed with 20% ketone ester supplement (KE; 1,3 butanediol-acetoacetate diester) to G1D mice for 10 weeks. Additionally, SPD rats and Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats were fed the SD, which was supplemented by oral gavage of KS or KE for 7 days (SPD rats: 5 g/kg body weight/day; WAG/Rij rats: 2.5 g/kg body weight/day). After these treatments (10 weeks for the mice, and 7 days for the rats) isoflurane (3%) was administered in an anesthesia chamber, and the time until anesthetic induction (time to immobility) was measured. Blood ketone levels were measured after anesthetic induction and correlation was calculated for blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) and anesthesia latency. RESULTS: Both KD and exogenous ketone supplementation increased blood ketone levels and delayed the onset of isoflurane-induced immobility in all investigated rodent models, showing positive correlation between the two measurements. These results demonstrate that elevated blood ketone levels by either KD or exogenous ketones delayed the onset of isoflurane-induced anesthesia in these animal models. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ketone levels might affect surgical anesthetic needs, or could potentially decrease or delay effects of other narcotic gases.",PPARGC1A; SIRT3; UCP2; HCAR2; HCAR1,mutUNG1 mice; cultured rat hippocampal neurons; human fibroblasts with H(2)O(2) induced oxidative stress,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells,"PGC1alpha-SIRT3-UCP2 axis, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,hippocampal pyramidal neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Mitochondrial dysfunction,Metabolic & Endocrine,"mitochondrial function, up","Mitochondrial function, up",KD; ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate,Ketogenic diet (endogenous); Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
30071599,A Ketogenic Diet Improves Mitochondrial Biogenesis and Bioenergetics via the PGC1alpha-SIRT3-UCP2 Axis.,"A ketogenic diet (KD; high-fat, low-carbohydrate) can benefit refractory epilepsy, but underlying mechanisms are unknown. We used mice inducibly expressing a mutated form of the mitochondrial DNA repair enzyme UNG1 (mutUNG1) to cause progressive mitochondrial dysfunction selectively in forebrain neurons. We examined the levels of mRNAs and proteins crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics. We show that hippocampal pyramidal neurons in mutUNG1 mice, as well as cultured rat hippocampal neurons and human fibroblasts with H(2)O(2) induced oxidative stress, improve markers of mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and function when fed on a KD, and when exposed to the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate, respectively, by upregulating PGC1alpha, SIRT3 and UCP2, and (in cultured cells) increasing the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the NAD(+)/NADH ratio. The mitochondrial level of UCP2 was significantly higher in the perikarya and axon terminals of hippocampus CA1 pyramidal neurons in KD treated mutUNG1 mice compared with mutUNG1 mice fed a standard diet. The beta-hydroxybutyrate receptor GPR109a (HCAR2), but not the structurally closely related lactate receptor GPR81 (HCAR1), was upregulated in mutUNG1 mice on a KD, suggesting a selective influence of KD on ketone body receptor mechanisms. We conclude that progressive mitochondrial dysfunction in mutUNG1 expressing mice causes oxidative stress, and that exposure of animals to KD, or of cells to ketone body in vitro, elicits compensatory mechanisms acting to augment mitochondrial mass and bioenergetics via the PGC1alpha-SIRT3-UCP2 axis (The compensatory processes are overwhelmed in the mutUNG1 mice by all the newly formed mitochondria being dysfunctional).",0,murine myotubes; rats in sustained ketosis,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Rat,"ceramide reduction, down",Cell Death & Survival,skeletal muscle,Skeletal muscle,myotubes,Muscle – Skeletal,Skeletal myocytes / myotubes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",provided as a fuel,NS,NS

However, there is a gap in our understanding of how ketones influence mitochondria within skeletal muscle cells. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the specific effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) on muscle cell mitochondrial physiology. In addition to increased cell viability, murine myotubes displayed beneficial mitochondrial changes evident in reduced H(2)O(2) emission and less mitochondrial fission, which may be a result of a beta-HB-induced reduction in ceramides. Furthermore, muscle from rats in sustained ketosis similarly produced less H(2)O(2) despite an increase in mitochondrial respiration and no apparent change in mitochondrial quantity. In sum, these results indicate a general improvement in muscle cell mitochondrial function when beta-HB is provided as a fuel.",HCAR2,wild-type mice; HCAR2-null mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"HCAR2 activation, up",Metabolic Regulation,sciatic nerve,Peripheral nerves & ganglia (PNS),ON cells,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Neuropathic pain,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"tactile allodynia, down","Mechanical allodynia, down",oral treatment,NS,NS

Here we show the unexplored role of the hydroxyl carboxylic acid receptor type 2 (HCAR2) in 2 models of neuropathic pain. We used an oral treatment with dimethyl fumarate and the HCAR2 endogenous ligand beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in wild-type (WT) and HCAR2-null mice. We found an up-regulation of the HCAR2 in the sciatic nerve and the dorsal root ganglia in neuropathic mice. Accordingly, acute and chronic treatment with dimethylfumarate (DMF) and BHB reduced the tactile allodynia. This effect was completely lost in the HCAR2-null mice after a 2-d starvation protocol, in which the BHB reached the concentration able to activate the HCAR2-reduced tactile allodynia in female WT mice, but not in the HCAR2-null mice. Finally, we showed that chronic treatment with DMF reduced the firing of the ON cells (cells responding with an excitation after noxious stimulation) of the rostral ventromedial medulla. Our results pave the way for investigating the mechanisms by which HCAR2 regulates neuropathic pain plasticity.-Boccella, S., Guida, F., De Logu, F., De Gregorio, D., Mazzitelli, M., Belardo, C., Iannotta, M., Serra, N., Nassini, R., de Novellis, V., Geppetti, P., Maione, S., Luongo, L.

30197300,Food-Induced Increase of Acetylcholine in Mouse Hypothalamus.,"Using microdialysis in C57Bl6 mice, we monitored cholinergic activity in the hypothalamus. Food intake after an overnight fast caused a 3-fold increase of extracellular acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations in the hypothalamus. The effect lasted for about 30 min. Food containing no calories (kaolin pellets), or food that was presented but not accessible, also increased ACh release. In contrast, injections of glucose or beta-hydroxybutyrate did not change extracellular ACh. Mice deficient in muscarinic M(3) receptors had the same cholinergic response as wild-type mice. We conclude that the increase of ACh in the hypothalamus was not caused by local detection of nutrients but by anticipation of food intake. This suggests the involvement of motivational circuits in the basal forebrain which is reinforced by the fact that we found slight increases of ACh in the nucleus accumbens during feeding.",HNRNPA1; POU5F1; LMNB1,mice; vascular smooth muscle cells; endothelial cells,animal,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells,"hnRNP A1-Oct4-Lamin B1 pathway, up","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",vascular tissue,Vasculature,vascular smooth muscle cells; endothelial cells,Muscle – Smooth / Perivascular; Endothelial,Visceral smooth muscle; Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Vascular cell senescence,Aging & Frailty,"senescence, down","Cell survival, down",fasting; intraperitoneal injection,Fasting / Caloric restriction (endogenous); Intraperitoneal BHB,NS
30259779,beta-Hydroxybutyrate Prevents Vascular Senescence through hnRNP A1-Mediated Upregulation of Oct4.,"beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) elevation during fasting or caloric restriction is believed to induce anti-aging effects and alleviate aging-related neurodegeneration. However, whether beta-HB alters the senescence pathway in vascular cells remains unknown. Here we report that beta-HB promotes vascular cell quiescence, which significantly inhibits both stress-induced premature senescence and replicative senescence through p53-independent mechanisms. Further, we identify heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) as a direct binding target of beta-HB. beta-HB binding to hnRNP A1 markedly enhances hnRNP A1 binding with Octamer-binding transcriptional factor (Oct) 4 mRNA, which stabilizes Oct4 mRNA and Oct4 expression. Oct4 increases Lamin B1, a key factor against DNA damage-induced senescence. Finally, fasting and intraperitoneal injection of beta-HB upregulate Oct4 and Lamin B1 in both vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells in mice in vivo. We conclude that beta-HB exerts anti-aging effects in vascular cells by upregulating an hnRNP A1-induced Oct4-mediated Lamin B1 pathway.",HNRNPA1; POU5F1,endothelial cells; brain; middle-aged and old animals; people,animal; human; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells; NS; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"hnRNP A1 activation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,endothelial cells,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Cellular senescence,Aging & Frailty,"senescent cell formation, down","Cell senescence, down","increases in fasting, caloric restriction, and exercise",Fasting / Caloric restriction (endogenous),NS
30332647,Prevention of Senescence in Vasculature Through Quiescence.,"Prevention of cell senescence is a potential means to extend healthspan and perhaps lifespan. Agents that increase NAD+ levels, which are diminished with age, may be senopreventive through restoration of SIRT1 and normal mitochondrial activity. The ketone body [Formula: see text]-hydroxybutyrate ([Formula: see text]-HB) prevents senescence by inducing quiescence in endothelial cells. [Formula: see text]-HB activates hnRNP A1, which then binds and stabilizes Oct4 mRNA. In turn, expression of Oct4 in endothelial cells induces quiescence, which protects cells from DNA-damage-induced and replicative senescence, but not p53-mediated senescence. [Formula: see text]-HB, which increases in fasting, caloric restriction, and exercise, may synergize with agents that increase NAD+ levels in middle-aged and old animals and people to reduce the rate at which senescent cells form and alter metabolism. Moreover, observed induction of Oct4 by [Formula: see text]-HB in the brain as well suggests a possible nexus with reprogramming pathways in neural stem cells should be explored.

We hypothesized that dietary salt impacts metabolism in a salt-sensitive model of hypertension. An untargeted metabolomic approach demonstrates lower circulating levels of the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), in high salt-fed hypertensive rats. Despite the high salt intake, specific rescue of betaOHB levels by nutritional supplementation of its precursor, 1,3-butanediol, attenuates hypertension and protects kidney function. This beneficial effect of betaOHB was likely independent of gut-microbiotal and Th17-mediated effects of salt and instead facilitated by betaOHB inhibiting the renal Nlrp3 inflammasome. The juxtaposed effects of dietary salt and exercise on salt-sensitive hypertension, which decrease and increase betaOHB respectively, indicate that nutritional supplementation of a precursor of betaOHB provides a similar benefit to salt-sensitive hypertension as exercise.",0,rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"reactive oxygen species production, down",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,sensorimotor cortex,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Focal cortical stroke,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"functional recovery, improved","Neurological deficit score, improved",BHB,NS,NS
30382157,Imaging the Effects of beta-Hydroxybutyrate on Peri-Infarct Neurovascular Function and Metabolism.,"Background and Purpose- Recent evidence suggests great potential of metabolically targeted interventions for treating neurological disorders. We investigated the use of the endogenous ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as an alternate metabolic substrate for the brain in the acute phase of ischemia because postischemic hyperglycemia and brain glucose metabolism elevation compromise functional recovery. Methods- We delivered BHB (or vehicle) 1 hour after ischemic insult induced by cortical microinjection of endothelin-1 in sensorimotor cortex of rats. Two days after ischemic insult, the rats underwent multimodal characterization of the BHB effects. We examined glucose uptake on 2-Deoxy-d-glucose chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging, cerebral hemodynamics on continuous arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging, resting-state field potentials by intracerebral multielectrode arrays, Neurological Deficit Score, reactive oxygen species production, and astrogliosis and neuronal death. Results- When compared with vehicle-administered animals, BHB-treated cohort showed decreased peri-infarct neuronal glucose uptake which was associated with reduced oxidative stress, diminished astrogliosis and neuronal death. Functional examination revealed ameliorated neuronal functioning, normalized perilesional resting perfusion, and ameliorated cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia, suggesting improved functioning. Cellular and functional recovery of the neurogliovascular unit in the BHB-treated animals was associated with improved performance on the withdrawal test. Conclusions- We characterize the effects of the ketone body BHB administration at cellular and system levels after focal cortical stroke. The results demonstrate that BHB curbs the peri-infarct glucose-metabolism driven production of reactive oxygen species and astrogliosis, culminating in improved neurogliovascular and functional recovery.",IL15,obese mice; 3T3-L1 cells; M1-polarized cultured macrophages,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line; In vitro – Primary cells,"Il15 gene induction, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,epididymal adipose tissue,Adipose tissue,M1-polarized macrophages,Hematopoietic / Immune,Macrophages,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Obesity,Metabolic & Endocrine,"adipose tissue expansion, up; systemic glucose metabolism, no-change","Body fat mass, up; Blood glucose, no-change",ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

We previously reported that, in obese mice, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor ipragliflozin (Ipra) promoted the expansion of the epididymal adipose tissue (Epi) with increase of serum ketone body concentration. The Ipra-induced adipose tissue expansion did not deteriorate adipose inflammation, or systemic glucose/lipid metabolism, referred to as ""healthy adipose tissue expansion."" Here we found that Ipra promoted healthy adipose tissue expansion with a reduced ratio of pro-inflammatory M1-like adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) to anti-inflammatory M2-like ATMs. Ipra downregulated the gene expression of interleukin (IL)-15 (Il15) in stromal cells of Epi. IL-15 inhibited lipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells associated with downregulation of the lipogenic gene. Ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate suppressed Il15 gene induction in M1-polarized cultured macrophages, and a ketogenic diet reproduced the adipose tissue expansion without deteriorating systemic glucose metabolism in mice. Our data indicate that the phenotypic switch of ATMs could mediate healthy adipose tissue expansion by treatment with Ipra, and it may offer new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of adipose tissue expansion.",0,acute hippocampal slices; astrocyte cultures,in vitro,Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice; In vitro – Primary cells,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,astrocytes,Neural / Glial,Astrocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
30543786,GABA(A) Modulation of S100B Secretion in Acute Hippocampal Slices and Astrocyte Cultures.,"Astrocytes are the major glial cells in brain tissue and are involved, among many functions, ionic and metabolic homeostasis maintenance of synapses. These cells express receptors and transporters for neurotransmitters, including GABA. GABA signaling is reportedly able to affect astroglial response to injury, as evaluated by specific astrocyte markers such as glial fibrillary acid protein and the calcium-binding protein, S100B. Herein, we investigated the modulatory effects of the GABA(A) receptor on astrocyte S100B secretion in acute hippocampal slices and astrocyte cultures, using the agonist, muscimol, and the antagonists pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and bicuculline. These effects were analyzed in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), fluorocitrate (FLC), cobalt and barium. PTZ positively modify S100B secretion in hippocampal slices and astrocyte cultures; in contrast, bicuculline inhibited S100B secretion only in hippocampal slices. Muscimol, per se, did not change S100B secretion, but prevented the effects of PTZ and bicuculline. Moreover, PTZ-induced S100B secretion was prevented by TTX, FLC, cobalt and barium indicating a complex GABA(A) communication between astrocytes and neurons. The effects of two putative agonists of GABA(A), beta-hydroxybutyrate and methylglyoxal, on S100B secretion were also evaluated. In view of the neurotrophic role of extracellular S100B under conditions of injury, our data reinforce the idea that GABA(A) receptors act directly on astrocytes, and indirectly on neurons, to modulate astroglial response.",0,adult rat ventricular myocytes,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat,"excitation-contraction coupling, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,heart,Heart,ventricular myocyte,Muscle – Skeletal,Skeletal myocytes / myotubes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypoxia,General Signs & Symptoms,"protection against hypoxia, positive","Neuroprotection, positive",betaOHB,NS,NS
30552292,The effects of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate on isolated rat ventricular myocyte excitation-contraction coupling.,"beta-hydroxybutyrate is the primary ketone body produced by the body during ketosis and is used to meet its metabolic demands. The healthy adult heart derives most of its energy from fatty acid oxidation. However, in certain diseases, the heart alters its substrate preference and increases its ketone body metabolism. Little is known about the effects of betaOHB on ventricular myocyte excitation-contraction coupling. Therefore, we examined the effects of ketone body metabolism on single cell excitation-contraction coupling during normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Myocytes were isolated from adult rats, cultured for 18 h in RPMI 1640, RPMI 1640 no glucose, and M199, HEPES with/without various amount of betaOHB added. To simulate hypoxia, myocytes were incubated at 1%O(2), 5% CO(2) for 1 h followed by incubation at atmospheric oxygen (21%O(2),5% CO(2)) for 30 min before recordings. Recordings were obtained using an IonOptix system at 36+/-1ᵒ C. Myocytes were paced at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 Hz. We found that exposure to betaOHB had no effect on excitation-contraction coupling. However, culturing cells with betaOHB results in a significant increase in both contraction and calcium in RPMI 1640 media. Dose response experiments demonstrated 0.5 mM betaOHB is enough to increase myocyte contraction in the absence of glucose. However, betaOHB has no measurable effects on myocytes cultured in a nutrient rich media, M199, HEPES. Therefore, betaOHB improves single cell excitation-contraction coupling, is protective against hypoxia, and may be a beneficial adaptation for the heart during periods of nutrient scarcity and or metabolic dysregulation.",0,OLETF rats; LETO rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,noninfarcted myocardium,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Multi-disease,"acute survival rate, up","Survival, up",NS,NS,NS

Here, we examined the effects of an SGLT2 inhibitor on the acute survival rate after myocardial infarction (MI) in an animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and the possible involvement of modification of cardiac metabolomes and antioxidative proteins. MI was induced in DM Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats and Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) control rats. Treatment with empagliflozin (10 mg/kg per day, 14 days) before MI reduced blood glucose and increased blood and myocardial beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) levels in OLETF. Survival rate at 48 hours after MI was significantly lower in OLETF rats than in LETO rats (40% vs. 84%), and empagliflozin significantly improved the survival rate in OLETF rats to 70%, although the sizes of MI were comparable. Patterns of metabolomes and gene expression in the noninfarcted myocardium of OLETF rats were consistent with increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased glucose oxidation. The patterns were modified by empagliflozin, suggesting both increased glucose oxidation and ketone utilization in OLETF rats. Empagliflozin prevented reduction of ATP level in the noninfarcted myocardium after MI and significantly increased myocardial levels of Sirt3 and superoxide dismutase 2 in OLETF rats. Administration of betaOHB partially mimicked the effects of empagliflozin in OLETF rats.

30562540,Long-term ketone body therapy of severe multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: A case report.,"OBJECTIVES: Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) is the most severe disorder of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. Treatment of this disorder is difficult because the functional loss of the electron transfer flavoprotein makes energy supply from fatty acids impossible. Acetyl-CoA, provided by exogenous ketone bodies such as NassHB, is the only treatment option in severe cases. Short-term therapy attempts have shown positive results. To our knowledge, no reports exist concerning long-term application of ketone body salts in patients with severe MADD. METHODS: This case report is a detailed retrospective metabolic analysis of a boy with severe MADD. Treatment with sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate (NabetaHB) started 8 d after birth using gradually increasing doses. In the initial phase, metabolic and acid-base parameters were checked multiple times a day. After 8 y of standardized therapy with 16 g NabetaHB, substitution with calcium beta-hydroxybutyrate (CabetaHB) was attempted. In addition to the beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) supplementation, continuous adjustments were made to the child's nutrition to provide necessary nutrients. RESULTS: Treatment with betaHB salts leads to adverse effects like gastrointestinal discomfort and alkalosis. Measured concentrations of betaHB were predominantly at 0.1 mmol/L or below detectable concentration. Nutritional therapy based on amino acid and acylcarnitine profiles is a necessary part of the therapy in MADD. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with NabetaHB is lifesaving in cases of severe MADD but can have significant adverse effects. Supplementation with CabetaHB led to gastrointestinal discomfort and had no additional positive clinical effect. The determined tolerable dose of betaHB salt for long-term therapy was not high enough for a notable increase of betaHB concentrations in blood.",0,Xenopus laevis oocytes,in vitro,Animal – Other Mammal,"ionotropic receptor inhibition, down",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,brain,Brain/CNS,Xenopus laevis oocyte,Reproductive – Female,Oviduct / Cervical / Vaginal epithelium,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy; Alcohol withdrawal syndrome,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric; Toxicology / Poisoning,"seizure likelihood, down","Seizure activity, down",produced from the breakdown of fatty acids,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
30604923,Ketone body modulation of ligand-gated ion channels.,"Ketogenesis is a metabolic process wherein ketone bodies are produced from the breakdown of fatty acids. In humans, fatty acid catabolism results in the production of acetyl-CoA which can then be used to synthesize three ketone bodies: acetoacetate, acetone, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Ketogenesis occurs at a higher rate in situations of low blood glucose, such as during fasting, heavy alcohol consumption, and in situations of low insulin, as well as in individuals who follow a 'ketogenic diet' consisting of low carbohydrate and high fat intake. This diet has various therapeutic indications, including reduction of seizure likelihood in epileptic patients and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, the mechanisms underlying these therapeutic benefits are still unclear, with studies suggesting various mechanisms such as a shift in energy production in the brain, effects on neurotransmitter production, or effects on various protein targets. Two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus laevis oocytes was used to investigate the actions of ketone bodies on three ionotropic receptors: GABA(A), glycine, and NMDA receptors. While physiologically-relevant concentrations of acetone have little effect on inhibitory GABA or glycine receptors, beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibits the effects of agonists of these receptors at concentrations achieved in vivo. Additionally, both acetone and beta-hydroxybutyrate act as inhibitors of glutamate at the excitatory NMDA receptor. Due to the role of hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of epilepsy and alcohol withdrawal, the inhibitory actions of acetone and beta-hydroxybutyrate at NMDA receptors may underlie the therapeutic benefit of a ketogenic diet for these disorders.",0,Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats 18 months old,animal,Animal – Rat,"D-beta-hydroxybutyrate level, up",Metabolic Regulation,central nervous system,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Central nervous system oxygen toxicity,Toxicology / Poisoning,"latency to seizures, up; seizure severity, down","Seizure activity, up; Seizure severity, down","ketone ester (1,3-butanediol acetoacetate diester, KE); KE/2 (KE 5 g/kg + water 5 g/kg); KE + medium-chain triglycerides (KE 5 g/kg + MCT 5 g/kg); ketone salt (Na(+)/K(+) betaHB, KS) + MCT (KS 5 g/kg + MCT 5 g/kg)",Multi-source; Ketone ester (KE),D-BHB

A previous study showed that ketone ester (1,3-butanediol acetoacetate diester, KE) administration delayed latency to seizures (LS) in 3-month-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. This study explores the effect of exogenous ketone supplements in additional dosages and formulations on CNS-OT seizures in 18 months old SD rats, an age group correlating to human middle age. Ketogenic agents were given orally 60 min prior to exposure to hyperbaric oxygen and included control (water), KE (10 g/kg), KE/2 (KE 5 g/kg + water 5 g/kg), KE + medium-chain triglycerides (KE 5 g/kg + MCT 5 g/kg), and ketone salt (Na(+) /K(+) betaHB, KS) + MCT (KS 5 g/kg + MCT 5 g/kg). Rats were exposed to 100% oxygen at 5 atmospheres absolute (ATA). Upon seizure presentation (tonic-clonic movements) experiments were immediately terminated and blood was tested for glucose and D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-betaHB) levels. While blood D-betaHB levels were significantly elevated post-dive in all treatment groups, LS was significantly delayed only in KE (P = 0.0003), KE/2 (P = 0.023), and KE + MCT (P = 0.028) groups. In these groups, the severity of seizures appeared to be reduced, although these changes were significant only in KE-treated animals (P = 0.015). Acetoacetate (AcAc) levels were also significantly elevated in KE-treated animals. The LS in 18-month-old rats was delayed by 179% in KE, 219% in KE + MCT, and 55% in KE/2 groups, while only by 29% in KS + MCT.

Participants ingested 0.35 g/kg of BD or placebo 30 min before and 60 min during 85 min of steady-state exercise, which preceded a approximately 25- to 35-min TT (i.e., 7 kJ/kg). The ingestion of BD increased blood D-betaHB concentration throughout exercise (0.44-0.79 mmol/L) compared with placebo (0.11-0.16 mmol/L; all p < .001), which peaked 1 hr following the TT (1.38 +/- 0.35 vs. 0.34 +/- 0.24 mmol/L; p < .001).

Various lines of research suggest that abnormalities in energy metabolism are likely to be part of migraine pathophysiology. Previously, a ketogenic diet (KD) has been reported to lead to a drastic reduction in migraine frequency. An alternative method to a strict KD is inducing a mild nutritional ketosis (0.4-2 mmol/l) with exogenous ketogenic substances. The aim of this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover, single-centre trial is to demonstrate safety and superiority of beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) in mineral salt form over placebo in migraine prevention. METHODS/DESIGN: Forty-five episodic migraineurs (5-14 migraine days/months), with or without aura, aged between 18 and 65 years, will be recruited at headache clinics in Switzerland, Germany and Austria and via Internet announcements. After a 4-week baseline period, patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two trial arms and receive either the betaHB mineral salt or placebo for 12 weeks. This will be followed by a 4-week wash-out period, a subsequent second baseline period and, finally, another 12-week intervention with the alternative treatment. Co-medication with triptans (10 days per months) or analgesics (14 days per months) is permitted. The primary outcome is the mean change from baseline in the number of migraine days (meeting International Classification of Headache Disorders version 3 criteria) during the last 4 weeks of intervention compared to placebo. Secondary endpoints include mean changes in headache days of any severity, acute migraine medication use, migraine intensity and migraine and headache-related disability. Exploratory outcomes are (in addition to routine laboratory analysis) genetic profiling and expression analysis, oxidative and nitrosative stress, as well as serum cytokine analysis, and blood betaHB and glucose analysis (pharmacokinetics). DISCUSSION: A crossover design was chosen as it greatly improves statistical power and participation rates, without increasing costs. To our knowledge this is the first RCT using betaHB salts worldwide. If proven effective and safe, betaHB might not only offer a new prophylactic treatment option for migraine patients, but might additionally pave the way for clinical trials assessing its use in related diseases.

In this context, the present study highlights an upregulation of retinal HCA2 receptors in diabetic C57BL6J mice. Moreover, we illustrate that HCA2 receptors exert an anti-inflammatory effect on the retinal damage induced by diabetes when activated by the endogenous ligand beta-hydroxybutyrate. METHODOLOGY: Seven-to-10-week-old C57BL6J mice were rendered diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (75 mg/kg of body weight) and monitored intermittently over a 10-week period extending from the initial diabetes assessment. Mice with a fasting blood glucose level higher than 250 mg/dl for 2 consecutive weeks after streptozotocin injection were treated twice a week with intraperitoneal injections of 25-50-100 mg/kg beta-hydroxybutyrate. RESULTS: Interestingly, while the retinal endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (pPERK, pIRE1, ATF-6alpha) were elevated in diabetic C57BL6J mice, their levels were significantly reduced by the systemic intraperitoneal treatment with 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg beta-hydroxybutyrate. These mice also exhibited high NLRP3 inflammasome activity and proinflammatory cytokine levels. In fact, the elevated levels of retinal NLRP3 inflammasome activation markers (NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1) and of the relative proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-18) were significantly reduced by 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment. These doses also reduced the high apoptotic cell number exhibited by the diabetic mice in the retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL) and increased the ONL low connexin 43 expression, leading to an improvement in retinal permeability and homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the systemic treatment of diabetic C57BL6J mice with BHB activates retinal HCA2 and inhibits local damage.",NOX4; 0,OLETF; LETO; NRK-52E cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"NOX reduction, down",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,kidney,Kidney,NRK-52E cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Myocardial infarction,Cardiovascular,"renal injury, down","Kidney function, down",NS,NS,NS

Recent clinical trials have shown that a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor improved both cardiac and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but effects of an SGLT2 inhibitor on cardiorenal syndrome remain unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats [OLETF]) and control (Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats [LETO]) were treated with canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, for 2 weeks. Renal tissues were analyzed at 12 h after MI with or without preoperative fasting. RESULTS: Canagliflozin reduced blood glucose levels in OLETF, and blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were increased by canagliflozin only with fasting. MI increased neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1 protein levels in the kidney by 3.2- and 1.6-fold, respectively, in OLETF, but not in LETO. The renal messenger ribonucleic acid level of Toll-like receptor 4 was higher in OLETF than in LETO after MI, whereas messenger ribonucleic acid levels of cytokines/chemokines were not significantly different. Levels of lipid peroxides, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX)2 and NOX4 proteins after MI were significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO. Canagliflozin with pre-MI fasting suppressed MI-induced renal expression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1 in OLETF, together with reductions in lipid peroxides and NOX proteins in the kidney. Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels before MI were inversely correlated with neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin protein levels in OLETF. Pre-incubation with beta-hydroxybutyrate attenuated angiotensin II-induced upregulation of NOX4 in NRK-52E cells. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitor treatment with a fasting period protects kidneys from MI-induced cardiorenal syndrome, possibly by beta-hydroxybutyrate-mediated reduction of NOXs and oxidative stress, in type 2 diabetic rats.",0; SIRT1; STK11,Hepa1c1c7 cells; HepG2 cells; mouse livers,animal; in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line; Animal – Mouse,"SIRT1-independent suppression of ER stress, down",General Stress Responses,liver,Liver,hepatoma cells,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,endoplasmic reticulum,Endoplasmic Reticulum,Unspecified,Endoplasmic reticulum stress in liver,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"cell viability, up; apoptosis, down","Cell viability, up; Apoptosis, down",intraperitoneal administration,Intraperitoneal BHB,NS

To elucidate the role of BHB in the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we examined the effects of BHB on hepatic ER stress induced by tunicamycin. In mouse hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells, BHB treatment suppressed the protein expression of ER stress responsive genes and increased cell viability, while reducing the protein expression of apoptosis inducible genes, without causing any alterations in the protein expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) or the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase. The intraperitoneal administration of BHB also reduced the protein expression of ER stress responsive genes in mouse livers. In human hepatoma HepG2 cells, the protein expression levels of ER stress responsive genes were increased by the partial inhibition of BHB production with siRNA targeting endogenous 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) lyase, whereas they were decreased by promoting BHB production with fenofibrate. These findings revealed that BHB helps to suppress hepatic ER stress via a SIRT1-independent pathway, and it might be possible to manipulate ER stress by regulating BHB production genetically or pharmacologically.",FOXO3; MT2A; EP300; 0,mouse kidney; rat myotubes; endothelial cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells,"histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,kidney,Kidney,endothelial cells,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",produced by the liver during fasting,Fasting / Caloric restriction (endogenous),D-BHB

Butyrate, produced by enteric butyric bacteria, is present at millimolar concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract and at lower levels in blood; R-beta-hydroxybutyrate, the main ketone body, produced by the liver during fasting can reach millimolar concentrations in the circulation. Both molecules have been shown to be histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and their administration has been associated to an improved metabolic profile and better cellular oxidative status, with butyrate inducing PGC1alpha and fatty acid oxidation and R-beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulating oxidative stress resistance factors FOXO3A and MT2 in mouse kidney. Because of the chemical and functional similarity between the two molecules, we compared here their impact on multiple cell types, evaluating i) histone acetylation and hydroxybutyrylation levels by immunoblotting, ii) transcriptional regulation of metabolic and inflammatory genes by quantitative PCR and iii) cytokine secretion profiles using proteome profiling array analysis. We confirm that butyrate is a strong HDAC inhibitor, a characteristic we could not identify in R-beta-hydroxybutyrate in vivo nor in vitro. Butyrate had an extensive impact on gene transcription in rat myotubes, upregulating PGC1alpha, CPT1b, mitochondrial sirtuins (SIRT3-5), and the mitochondrial anti-oxidative genes SOD2 and catalase. In endothelial cells, butyrate suppressed gene expression and LPS-induced secretion of several pro-inflammatory genes, while R-beta-hydroxybutyrate acted as a slightly pro-inflammatory molecule. Our observations indicate that butyrate induces transcriptional changes to a higher extent than R-beta-hydroxybutyrate in rat myotubes and endothelial cells, in keep with its HDAC inhibitory activity. Also, in contrast with previous reports, R-beta-hydroxybutyrate, while inducing histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation, did not display a readily detectable HDAC inhibitor activity and exerted a slight pro-inflammatory action on endothelial cells.",0,"type 1 diabetes; adults (n=10, 23±5 y); canagliflozin treatment",human,NS; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"ketogenesis, no-change",Metabolic Regulation,plasma,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Metabolic & Endocrine,"ketogenesis suppression, no-change","Ketogenesis, no-change",NS,NS,NS

BHB and free fatty acid (FFA) were monitored every 30 min for 120 min after receiving a 0.2 U/kg subcutaneous injection of aspart insulin. RESULTS: Ten adults (23 +/- 5 years) were studied. During the 120 min after rescue therapy with insulin, the reductions in BHB and FFA were nearly identical between the pre- and during canagliflozin treatment studies, respectively (-1.27 +/- 0.76 and -1.13 +/- 0.69, P = 0.671 for BHB and -0.50 +/- 0.35 vs. -0.41 +/- 0.41, P = 0.603 for FFA).

METHODS: HLECs were divided into subgroups: four HDACi groups, a control group, a UVB-treated group and a DMSO group (cells treated with DMSO and UVB irradiation). In the HDACi groups, HLECs were cultured with different concentrations of HDACis 12 h prior to UVB irradiation. The protective effects of the HDACis were evaluated by assessing apoptosis rates, cell activity and expression levels of genes associated with apotosis (caspase-3, Bcl-2, BAX, SOD1, FOXO3A and MT2). The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were detected in order to evaluate oxidative stress. RESULTS: The results showed that SAHA (1 mumol/L, 2 mumol/L) and TSA (0.2 mumol/L) had mild protective effects on cell viability. betaOHB (4 mmol/L) and TSA (0.2 mol/L) demonstrated protective effects on BCL-2 expression. TSA (0.2 mol/L) showed protective effects on SOD1 expression. TSA (0.2 mol/L) and SAHA (1 mumol/L) suppressed BAX and caspase-3 expression. TSA (0.2 mol/L, 0.8 mol/L) and SAHA (1 mumol/L, 2 mumol/L) suppressed the expression of FOXO3A and MT2. SOD levels were increased after treatment with betaOHB (4 mmol/L), SAHA (8 mumol/L) and TSA (0.1 mol/L, 0.2 mol/L). T-AOC levels were increased in UVB-treated HLECs after treatment with SAHA (2 mumol/L). MDA levels decreased in UVB-treated HLECs following treatment with TSA (0.2 mol/L, 0.8 mol/L). ROS levels decreased in UVB-treated HLECs following treatment with betaOHB (4 mmol/L), SAHA (1 mumol/L, 2 mumol/L) and TSA (0.2 mol/L). Western blotting results demonstrated that SOD1 levels significantly increased in the betaOHB (4 mmol/L), SAHA (1 mumol/L, 2 mumol/L), TSA (0.1 mol/L, 0.2 mol/L) and VPA (5 mmol/L) groups. Only SAHA (1 mumol/L) had an anti-apoptotic effect on UVB-treated HLECs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that low concentrations of HDACis (1 mumol/L of SAHA) mildly inhibit oxidative stress, thus protecting HLECs from oxidation.

Although ketone oxidation has been shown recently to increase in the failing heart, it remains unknown whether this improves cardiac energy production or efficiency. We therefore assessed cardiac metabolism in failing hearts and determined whether increasing ketone oxidation improves cardiac energy production and efficiency. METHODS AND RESULTS: C57BL/6J mice underwent sham or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery to induce pressure overload hypertrophy over 4-weeks. Isolated working hearts from these mice were perfused with radiolabelled beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), glucose, or palmitate to assess cardiac metabolism. Ejection fraction decreased by 45% in TAC mice. Failing hearts had decreased glucose oxidation while palmitate oxidation remained unchanged, resulting in a 35% decrease in energy production. Increasing betaOHB levels from 0.2 to 0.6 mM increased ketone oxidation rates from 251 +/- 24 to 834 +/- 116 nmol.g dry wt-1 . min-1 in TAC hearts, rates which were significantly increased compared to sham hearts and occurred without decreasing glycolysis, glucose, or palmitate oxidation rates. Therefore, the contribution of ketones to energy production in TAC hearts increased to 18% and total energy production increased by 23%. Interestingly, glucose oxidation, in parallel with total ATP production, was also significantly upregulated in hearts upon increasing betaOHB levels. However, while overall energy production increased, cardiac efficiency was not improved.

In this study, we investigated whether renal aging-related inflammation is modulated by HB. We compared aged rats administered with HB to calorie restricted rats and examined the modulation of FoxO1 and the NF-kappaB pathway through interactions with PGC-1alpha. We found that in aged rats treated with HB, pro-inflammatory signaling changes were reversed and showed effects comparable to CR. As FoxO1 and its target genes catalase/MnSOD were upregulated by HB treatment and PGC-1alpha selectively interacted with FoxO1, not with NF-kappaB, and ameliorated the renal inflammatory response. These findings were further confirmed using FoxO1 overexpression and siRNA transfection in vitro. Our findings suggest that HB suppressed aging-related inflammation as a CR mimetic by enabling the co-activation and selective interaction between FoxO1 and PGC-1alpha.

We evaluated the impact of beta-OHB on renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Mice were treated with a continuous infusion of beta-OHB using an osmotic mini-pump before and after IRI. We also tested the effects of increasing endogenous serum beta-OHB levels by fasting. Renal IRI was attenuated by beta-OHB treatment compared to saline control, with similar results in the fasting condition. beta-OHB treatment reduced the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and increased expression of forkhead transcription factor O3 (FOXO3), an upstream regulator of pyroptosis. Although beta-OHB treatment did not impact markers of apoptosis, it decreased the expression of caspase-1 and proinflammatory cytokines, indicating that beta-OHB blocked pyroptosis. In a human proximal tubular cell line exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation, beta-OHB reduced cell death in a FOXO3-dependent fashion. Histone acetylation was decreased in kidneys exposed to IRI and in proximal tubular cells exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation, and this effect was ameliorated by beta-OHB through the inactivation of histone deacetylases. In vitro, beta-OHB treatment restored histone acetylation at the FOXO3 promoter. Consistent with epigenetic molecular effects, the renoprotective effects of beta-OHB were still observed when the continuous infusion was stopped at the time of IRI. Thus, beta-OHB attenuates renal IRI through anti-pyroptotic effects, likely mediated by an epigenetic effect on FOXO3 expression.",HDAC1; HDAC3; HDAC4; HDAC5; CASP3; 0; PRKAA1,HRCE cells; HEK293 cells,human; in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"activation of HDAC5, up",Epigenetic Regulation,renal cortex,Kidney,HRCE cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal epithelium (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity,Renal & Urological,"apoptosis, down","Apoptosis, down",NS,NS,NS
30877806,"beta-Hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body, reduces the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin via activation of HDAC5 in human renal cortical epithelial cells.","AIMS: beta-Hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) is a metabolic intermediate that constitutes about 70% of ketone bodies produced in liver from oxidation of fatty acids released from adipose tissue. A recent study showed that betaOHB inhibits HDAC1, 3 and 4 (classes I and IIa) in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Therefore, betaOHB could regulate epigenetics via modulating HDACs. However, little is known about the protective effect of betaOHB on renal cells through epigenetics. The aim of this study is to investigate whether betaOHB reduces cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in human renal cortical epithelial (HRCE) cells by modulating HDACs. MAIN METHODS: In this study, we used human renal cortical epithelial (HRCE) cells. The anti-apoptotic effect of betaOHB was evaluated using flow cytometry analysis. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins and HDACs was evaluated by western immunoblot. KEY FINDINGS: The results showed that betaOHB significantly reduced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in HRCE cells. Furthermore, betaOHB significantly reduced cisplatin-induced cleavage of caspase-3, acetylation of histone H3, and phosphorylation of AMP-activated kinase. This anti-apoptotic effect of betaOHB was markedly attenuated by an inhibitor of HDAC4/5, and betaOHB-mediated suppression of cleavage of caspase3 was significantly blocked by siRNA-induced gene silencing of HDAC5. SIGNIFICANCE: betaOHB attenuates cisplatin-induced apoptosis by activation of HDAC5 in HRCE cells, suggesting that betaOHB may be a new therapeutic agent for cisplatin nephropathy.",0,healthy adults (n = 29); US military personnel,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"fat oxidation, up",Metabolic Regulation,visceral fat,Adipose tissue,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"insulin sensitivity, up","Insulin sensitivity, up",ketogenic diet (KD),Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
30903979,Extended Ketogenic Diet and Physical Training Intervention in Military Personnel.,"INTRODUCTION: Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate ketones into a range referred to as nutritional ketosis represent a possible nutrition approach to address the emerging physical readiness and obesity challenge in the military. An emerging body of evidence demonstrates broad-spectrum health benefits attributed to being in nutritional ketosis, but no studies have specifically explored the use of a KD in a military population using daily ketone monitoring to personalize the diet prescription. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the feasibility, metabolic, and performance responses of an extended duration KD, healthy adults (n = 29) from various military branches participated in a supervised 12-wk exercise training program. Fifteen participants self-selected to an ad libitum KD guided by daily measures of capillary blood ketones and 14 continued their normal mixed diet (MD). A battery of tests were performed before and after the intervention to assess changes in body mass, body composition, visceral fat, liver fat, insulin sensitivity, resting energy metabolism, and physical performance. RESULTS: All KD subjects were in nutritional ketosis during the intervention as assessed by daily capillary beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) (mean betaHB 1.2 mM reported 97% of all days) and showed higher rates of fat oxidation indicative of keto-adaptation. Despite no instruction regarding caloric intake, the KD group lost 7.7 kg body mass (range -3.5 to -13.6 kg), 5.1% whole-body percent fat (range -0.5 to -9.6%), 43.7% visceral fat (range 3.0 to -66.3%) (all p < 0.001), and had a 48% improvement in insulin sensitivity; there were no changes in the MD group. Adaptations in aerobic capacity, maximal strength, power, and military-specific obstacle course were similar between groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: US military personnel demonstrated high adherence to a KD and showed remarkable weight loss and improvements in body composition, including loss of visceral fat, without compromising physical performance adaptations to exercise training. Implementation of a KD represents a credible strategy to enhance overall health and readiness of military service members who could benefit from weight loss and improved body composition.",0,DPPC bilayers; giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) formed by phase-separating lipid mixtures; POPC giant vesicles,in vitro,In vitro – Organoids/3D cultures,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
30912285,"Effect of ectoine, hydroxyectoine and beta-hydroxybutyrate on the temperature and pressure stability of phospholipid bilayer membranes of different complexity.","Previous research has shown that ectoines fluidize lipid monolayers by increasing the liquid expanded region in DPPC monolayers and also decreasing the line tension responsible for the phase morphology. Here, we explored possible effects of the compatible osmolytes ectoine, hydroxyectoine and beta-hydroxybutyrate on lipid bilayer membranes, including effects of temperature and pressure. The effect of the protective osmolytes on the phase transition of DPPC bilayers was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and pressure perturbation calorimetry. A slight change of the phase behavior was observed, which resulted in a stabilization of the gel phase, which may be caused by an alteration of the hydration properties at the lipid interface and H-bond and electrostatic interactions in the headgroup region. We then explored the cosolvents' effects on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) formed by lipid mixtures exhibiting phase separation into liquid-ordered (l(o)) and liquid-disordered (l(d)) domains using BODIPY-PC and the DiI(18) dye as labels. The presence of both, ectoine and hydroxyectoine showed significant effects on the lateral organization increasing the fluid domains. Moreover, we observed a considerable increase in the adhesion behavior of small vesicles onto GUV surfaces. Diffusion studies by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments on POPC giant vesicles quantitatively showed a hydroxyectoine-induced increase of the diffusion coefficient values, clearly demonstrating an increase in the lateral mobility of lipid within the bilayer membrane. This study provides clear evidence for the fluidizing effect of the compatible solutes on bilayer lipid membranes.

30930744,Oral Ketone Supplementation Acutely Increases Markers of NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation in Human Monocytes.,"SCOPE: Cell culture studies indicate that the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) directly inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key regulator of inflammation. However, direct evidence demonstrating this effect in humans is lacking. METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine the effects of acutely raising blood beta-OHB in healthy humans, two separate randomized double-blind placebo-controlled experiments are conducted using similar methods but each employed different exogenous ketone supplements. Participants' blood beta-OHB is directly elevated by ketone salts (0.3 g beta-OHB per kg; Study 1, N = 10 males) or ketone monoester (0.482 g beta-OHB per kg; Study 2, N = 18, equal males/females). Markers of NLRP3 inflammasome activation include caspase-1, IL-1beta secretion, and IL1B and NLRP3 mRNA in LPS-stimulated whole blood collected at the baseline and 30 minutes following supplementation. Caspase-1 activation increases after ketone salt (Study 1: condition x time interaction, p = 0.012) and monoester supplementation (Study 2: condition x time interaction, p = 0.016) compared to placebo. IL-1beta secretion increases (main effect of condition, p = 0.024; Study 2) while IL1B and NLRP3 mRNA remain unchanged. CONCLUSION: Measures of NLRP3 activation increases when blood beta-OHB is elevated using ketone supplements, suggesting that increasing beta-OHB exogenously may have unintended effects that augment inflammatory activation.",0,Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"inflammatory processes, NS",Inflammation & Immune Response,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"spike-wave discharge (SWD) number, down","Seizure activity, down",10% KE + 10% ketone salt/KS in standard rodent chow (KEKS),Multi-source,NS
30984015,Exogenous Ketone Supplementation Decreased the Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Increase in Absence Epileptic Activity in Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk Rats.,"It has been demonstrated previously that exogenous ketone supplements such as ketone ester (KE) decreased absence epileptic activity in a well-studied animal model of human absence epilepsy, Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats. It is known that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-generated changes in inflammatory processes increase absence epileptic activity, while previous studies show that ketone supplement-evoked ketosis can modulate inflammatory processes. Thus, we investigated in the present study whether administration of exogenous ketone supplements, which were mixed with standard rodent chow (containing 10% KE + 10% ketone salt/KS, % by weight, KEKS) for 10 days, can modulate the LPS-evoked changes in absence epileptic activity in WAG/Rij rats. At first, KEKS food alone was administered and changes in spike-wave discharge (SWD) number, SWD time, discharge frequency within SWDs, blood glucose, and beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) levels, as well as body weight and sleep-waking stages were measured. In a separate experiment, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of LPS (50 mug/kg) alone and a cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2) inhibitor indomethacin (10 mg/kg) alone, as well as combined IP injection of indomethacin with LPS (indomethacin + LPS) were applied in WAG/Rij rats to elucidate their influences on SWD number. In order to determine whether KEKS food can modify the LPS-evoked changes in SWD number, KEKS food in combination with IP LPS (50 mug/kg) (KEKS + LPS), as well as KEKS food with IP indomethacin (10 mg/kg) and LPS (50 mug/kg) (KEKS + indomethacin + LPS) were also administered. We demonstrated that KEKS food significantly increased blood betaHB levels and decreased not only the spontaneously generated absence epileptic activity (SWD number), but also the LPS-evoked increase in SWD number in WAG/Rij rats. Our results suggest that administration of exogenous ketone supplements (ketogenic foods) may be a promising therapeutic tool in the treatment of epilepsy.",0,athletically trained individuals; incremental bicycle ergometer exercise test,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Human – Interventional,"minute ventilation, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"exercise performance, no-change","Exercise capacity, no-change","(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3-butanediol","1,3-Butanediol (BD)",D-BHB
31024341,Nutritional Ketoacidosis During Incremental Exercise in Healthy Athletes.,"Purpose: Ketosis, achieved through ingestion of ketone esters, may influence endurance exercise capacity by altering substrate metabolism. However, the effects of ketone consumption on acid-base status and subsequent metabolic and respiratory compensations are poorly described. Methods: Twelve athletically trained individuals completed an incremental bicycle ergometer exercise test to exhaustion following the consumption of either a ketone ester [(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3-butanediol] or a taste-matched control drink (bitter flavoured water) in a blinded, cross-over study. Respiratory gases and arterialised blood gas samples were taken at rest and at regular intervals during exercise. Results: Ketone ester consumption increased blood D-beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration from 0.2 to 3.7 mM/L (p < 0.01), causing significant falls versus control in blood pH to 7.37 and bicarbonate to 18.5 mM/L before exercise. To compensate for ketoacidosis, minute ventilation was modestly increased (p < 0.05) with non-linearity in the ventilatory response to exercise (ventilatory threshold) occurring at a 22 W lower workload (p < 0.05). Blood pH and bicarbonate concentrations were the same at maximal exercise intensities. There was no difference in exercise performance having consumed the ketone ester or control drink. Conclusion: Athletes compensated for the greater acid load caused by ketone ester ingestion by elevating minute ventilation and earlier hyperventilation during incremental exercise.",0; MFN2; DNM1L; MAP1LC3B,young rabbits (2.5 months); aged rabbits (2.5 years); aged rabbits with HF induced by aortic insufficiency and stenosis,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"mitophagy, up",Cell Death & Survival,heart,Heart,cardiomyocytes,Muscle – Cardiac,Cardiomyocytes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Aging; Heart failure,Aging & Frailty; Cardiovascular,"mitochondrial repair, up","Mitochondrial repair, up",NS,NS,NS
31051088,Mitochondrial Quality Control in Aging and Heart Failure: Influence of Ketone Bodies and Mitofusin-Stabilizing Peptides.,"Aim: Aging and heart failure (HF) are each characterized by increased mitochondrial damage, which may contribute to further cardiac dysfunction. Mitophagy in response to mitochondrial damage can improve cardiovascular health. HF is also characterized by increased formation and consumption of ketone bodies (KBs), which may activate mitophagy and provide an endogenous mechanism to limit the adverse effects of mitochondrial damage. However, the role of KBs in activation of mitophagy in aging and HF has not been evaluated. Methods: We assessed mitophagy by measuring mitochondrial Parkin accumulation and LC3-mediated autophagosome formation in cardiomyocytes from young (2.5 months), aged (2.5 years), and aged rabbits with HF (2.5 years) induced by aortic insufficiency and stenosis. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and redox balance were monitored using genetically encoded sensors ORP1-roGFP2 and GRX1-roGFP2, targeted to mitochondrial or cytosolic compartments, respectively. Results: Young rabbits exhibited limited mitochondrial Parkin accumulation with small (~1 mum(2)) puncta. Those small Parkin puncta increased four-fold in aged rabbit hearts, accompanied by elevated LC3-mediated autophagosome formation. HF hearts exhibited fewer small puncta, but many very large Parkin-rich regions (4-5 mum(2)) with completely depolarized mitochondria. Parkin protein expression was barely detectable in young animals and was much higher in aged and maximal in HF hearts. Expression of mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) was reduced by almost 50% in HF, consistent with improper fusion-fission, contributing to mitochondrial Parkin build-up. The KB beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) enhanced mitophagy in young and aging myocytes, but not in HF where beta-OHB further increased the number of cells with giant Parkin-rich regions. This beta-OHB effect on Parkin-rich areas was prevented by cell-permeable TAT-MP1(Gly) peptide (thought to promote MFN2-dependent fusion). Basal levels of mitochondrial ROS were highest in HF, while cytosolic ROS was highest in aged compared to HF myocytes, suggesting that cytosolic ROS promotes Parkin recruitment to the mitochondria. Conclusion: We conclude that elevated KB levels were beneficial for mitochondrial repair in the aging heart. However, an impaired MFN2-DRP1-mediated fusion-fission process in HF reduced this benefit, as well as Parkin degradation and mitophagic signaling cascade.",TBC1D4; PDPK1; PRKAA1; ACACA,Male ICR mice; isolated epitrochlearis muscle,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"Akt phosphorylation, up",Metabolic Regulation,epitrochlearis muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"glycogen repletion, up","Glycogen repletion, up",sodium beta-HB,Ketone salt (KS),NS

Male ICR mice swam for 60 min and then their epitrochlearis muscles were removed and incubated with either physiological levels of glucose (8 mmol/L) and insulin (60 muU/mL) or glucose and insulin plus 1, 2, or 4 mmol/L of sodium beta-HB. Four millimoles per liter beta-HB had a significant positive effect on glycogen repletion in epitrochlearis muscle at 120 min after exercise (p < 0.01), while 2 mmol/L of beta-HB showed a tendency to increase the glycogen level (p < 0.09), and 1 mmol/L of beta-HB had no significant effect. We further investigated the effect of 4 mmol/L beta-HB treatment on the signaling cascade related to glycogen repletion in the epitrochlearis muscles throughout a 120-min recovery period. After incubating the muscles in 4 mmol/L of beta-HB for 15 min postexercise, the Akt substrate of 160 kDa Thr(642) (p < 0.05) and Akt Thr(308) (p < 0.05) phosphorylations were significantly increased compared with the control treatment. At the same time point, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase phosphorylations were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the epitrochlearis muscle incubated with 4 mmol/L of beta-HB than in the control muscle. Our results demonstrate that postexercise 4 mmol/L beta-HB administration enhanced glycogen repletion in epitrochlearis muscle. Four millimoles per liter beta-HB treatment was associated with alternation of the phosphorylated status of several proteins involved in glucose uptake and metabolic/energy homeostasis at the early stage of postexercise.",0,healthy older adults,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration, up",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cognitive function, no-change; memory-related neuronal activity, no-change","Cognition, no-change; Memory (general), no-change",GSK2981710 (medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)),MCT / Medium-chain fats,NS

METHODS: Part 1 was a four-period dose-selection study (n = 8 complete). Part 2 was a two-period crossover study (n = 80 complete) assessing the acute (Day 1) and prolonged (Day 15) effects of GSK2981710 on cognition and memory-related neuronal activity. Safety and tolerability of MCT supplementation were monitored in both parts of the study. RESULTS: The most common adverse event was diarrhoea (100% and 75% of participants in Parts 1 and 2, respectively). Most adverse events were mild to moderate, and 11% participants were withdrawn due to one or more adverse events. Although GSK2981710 (30 g/day) resulted in increased peak plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations, no significant improvements in cognitive function or memory-related neuronal activity were observed. CONCLUSION: Over a duration of 14 days, increasing plasma BHB levels with daily administration of GSK2981710 had no effects on neuronal activity or cognitive function. This result indicates that modulating plasma ketone levels with GSK2981710 may be ineffective in improving cognitive function in healthy older adults, or the lack of observed effect could be related to several factors including study population, plasma BHB concentrations, MCT composition, or treatment duration.",0,mice; aged mice; Prdm16 knockout mice; PRDM16-overexpressing aged mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"fibrogenesis, down",Extracellular Matrix & Structural Remodeling,adipose tissue,Adipose tissue,adipocyte precursor cells,Adipose,White adipocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Adipose tissue fibrosis,Metabolic & Endocrine,"adipose fibrosis, down","Fibrosis, down",secreted by PRDM16-expressing adipose cells; dietary BHB supplementation,NS; Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

We found that cold exposure or beta3-adrenergic agonist treatment of mice decreased the fibrogenic profile of precursor cells and stimulated beige adipocyte differentiation. This fibrogenic-to-adipogenic transition was impaired in aged animals, correlating with reduced adipocyte expression of the transcription factor PRDM16. Genetic loss of Prdm16 mimicked the effect of aging in promoting fibrosis, whereas increasing PRDM16 in aged mice decreased fibrosis and restored beige adipose development. PRDM16-expressing adipose cells secreted the metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which blocked precursor fibrogenesis and facilitated beige adipogenesis. BHB catabolism in precursor cells, mediated by BDH1, was required for beige fat differentiation in vivo. Finally, dietary BHB supplementation in aged animals reduced adipose fibrosis and promoted beige fat formation.

31280254,Up-regulation of FOXO1 and reduced inflammation by beta-hydroxybutyric acid are essential diet restriction benefits against liver injury.,"Liver ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major challenge in liver surgery. Diet restriction reduces liver damage by increasing stress resistance; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the preventive effect of 12-h fasting on mouse liver IRI. Partial warm hepatic IRI model in wild-type male C57BL/6 mice was used. The control ischemia and reperfusion (IR) group of mice was given food and water ad libitum, while the fasting IR group was given water but not food for 12 h before ischemic insult. In 12-h fasting mice, serum liver-derived enzyme level and tissue damages due to IR were strongly suppressed. Serum beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) was significantly raised before ischemia and during reperfusion. Up-regulated BHB induced an increment in the expression of FOXO1 transcription factor by raising the level of acetylated histone. Antioxidative enzyme heme oxigenase 1 (HO-1), a target gene of FOXO1, then increased. Autophagy activity was also enhanced. Serum high-mobility group box 1 was remarkably lowered by the 12-h fasting, and activation of NF-kappaB and NLRP3 inflammasome was suppressed. Consequently, inflammatory cytokine production and liver injury were reduced. Exogenous BHB administration or histone deacetylase inhibitor administration into the control fed mice ameliorated liver IRI, while FOXO1 inhibitor administration to the 12-h fasting group exacerbated liver IRI. The 12-h fasting exerted beneficial effects on the prevention of liver IRI by increasing BHB, thus up-regulating FOXO1 and HO-1, and by reducing the inflammatory responses and apoptotic cell death via the down-regulation of NF-kappaB and NLRP3 inflammasome.",SIRT3; DLG4; SYP; 0,human ApoE3 transgenic mice; human ApoE4 transgenic mice (9-month-old),animal,Animal – Mouse,"neuronal energy metabolism, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,hippocampus; cortex,Brain/CNS,neuronal,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"learning and memory abilities, up","Memory (general), up",beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB): 600 mg/kg/day,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

ApoE4 carriers have cerebral hypometabolism which is thought as a harbinger of AD. Our previous studies indicated ketones improved mitochondria energy metabolism via sirtuin 3 (Sirt3). However, it is unclear whether ketones upregulate Sirt3 and improve ApoE4-related learning and memory deficits. RESULTS: Ketones improved learning and memory abilities of ApoE4 mice but not ApoE3 mice. Sirt3, synaptic proteins, the NAD(+)/ NADH ratio, and ATP production were significantly increased in the hippocampus and the cortex from ketone treatment. METHODS: Human ApoE3 and ApoE4 transgenic mice (9-month-old) were treated with either ketones or normal saline by daily subcutaneous injections for 3 months (ketones, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB): 600 mg/kg/day; acetoacetate (ACA): 150 mg/kg/day). Learning and memory ability of these mice were assessed. Sirt3 protein, synaptic proteins (PSD95, Synaptophysin), the NAD(+)/ NADH ratio, and ATP levels were measured in the hippocampus and the cortex. CONCLUSION: Our current studies suggest that ketones improve learning and memory abilities of ApoE4 transgenic mice. Sirt3 may mediate the neuroprotection of ketones by increasing neuronal energy metabolism in ApoE4 transgenic mice.

31344430,Ketone body therapy with D/L-beta-hydroxybutyric acid solution in severe MADD.,"OBJECTIVES: Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) is a severe inborn disorder of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The only treatment option for MADD is the use of exogenous ketone bodies, like sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate (NabetaHB). However, the use of ketone body salts leads to a high intake of accompanying minerals, which can lead to additional side effects. The use of mineral-free formulations could improve tolerability. METHODS: In this report, the use of a betaHB acid (betaHBA) in a patient with MADD is described. The production of D/L-betaHBA was carried out using ion exchange chromatography (IEX) and using a precipitation method. During two inpatient treatment intervals, the tolerability as well as clinical and metabolic effects were monitored. D-betaHB in serum, blood gas analysis, and standard blood measurements (like minerals) were used as control parameters. RESULTS: Production of D/L-betaHBA using the precipitation method was more effective than using IEX. The tube feed solution used had a minimum pH of 3.5. Capillary D-betaHB measurements were between 0.1 and 0.4 mmol/L and venous were at 0.1 mmol/L or below. Minerals and serum pH were within the normal range. During application of D/L-betaHBA, gastrointestinal discomfort occurred and no clinical improvement was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The use of D/L-betaHBA in the therapy of severe MADD could be a good addition to the use of classical ketone body salts. The observed gastrointestinal side effects were of a mild nature and could not be specifically attributed to the D/L-betaHBA treatment. In short-term application, no clinical benefit and no substantial increase of D-betaHB in serum were noted.

31364402,Physiological concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate do not promote adipocyte browning.,"AIMS: Previous work has demonstrated that ketogenic diets promote white fat browning; however, the exact mechanisms underlying this phenomenom have yet to be elucidated. Recently, an in vitro study showed that supraphysiological concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) had a strong influence on the induction of adipocyte browning. On the other hand, concentrations in the physiological range, achieved through ketogenic diets and prolonged fasting produce values of 1-3 mM and 4-7 mM, respectively. Herein, we investigated the impact of physiological concentrations of betaHB on metabolism, and the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and other browning markers in adipose tissues. MAIN METHODS: The effects of betaHB on adipocyte browning were investigated in vitro, using primary cultures of isolated visceral and subcutaneous fat cells and cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and in vivo. KEY FINDINGS: It was determined that betaHB failed to induce changes in the oxidative capacity, citrate synthase activity or browning gene expression patterns in isolated adipocytes, and did not exert a permissive effect on beta-adrenergic agonist-induced browning. In addition, 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated following betaHB treatment exhibited downregulated Ucp1 expression levels, a result that was recapitulated in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of Wistar rats after betaHB salt treatment. Rats administered betaHB salts also presented reduced brown adipose tissue UCP1 protein expression. SIGNIFICANCE: The mechanisms underlying ketogenic diet-induced browning of adipocytes are not known. The results from the present study indicate that physiological concentrations of betaHB are not responsible for this phenomenon, despite the observed betaHB-mediated downregulation of UCP1 expression.",0,db/db mice; control mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"hypermetabolism, up",Metabolic Regulation,mesenteric arteries,Vasculature,endothelial cells,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Type 2 diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"endothelial-dependent vasodilation, down","Endothelial function, down",[U-(13)C]beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
31442404,Hypermetabolism and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in mesenteric arteries of type 2 diabetes mellitus db/db mice.,"Besides being a metabolic disease, diabetes is considered a vascular disease as many of the complications relate to vascular pathologies. The aim of this study was to investigate how vascular tone and reactivity and vascular cell metabolism were affected in type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether beta-hydroxybutyrate could have a positive effect as alternative energy substrate. Isolated mesenteric arteries of db/db and control mice were incubated in media containing [U-(13)C]glucose or [U-(13)C]beta-hydroxybutyrate, and tissue extracts were analysed by mass spectrometry. Functional characterization was performed by wire myography to assess vasodilation and vasocontraction. Hypermetabolism of glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate was observed for mesenteric arteries of db/db mice; however, hypermetabolism was significant only with beta-hydroxybutyrate as energy substrate. The functional characterization showed impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation in mesenteric arteries of the db/db mice, whereas the contractility was unaffected. This study provides evidence that the endothelial cells are impaired, whereas the vascular smooth muscle cells are more robust and seemed less affected in the db/db mouse. Furthermore, the results indicate that hypermetabolism of energy substrates may be due to adaptive changes in the mesenteric arteries.",0,Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells,animal,Multi-model,"HDAC inhibition, down",Epigenetic Regulation,small intestine,Small intestine,Lgr5(+) ISCs,Stem / Progenitor / Pluripotent,Tissue-specific progenitors (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"post-injury regeneration, up","Neuroprotection, up",exogenous betaOHB; high-fat ketogenic diet,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid); Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
31456369,Ketone Body Signaling Mediates Intestinal Stem Cell Homeostasis and Adaptation to Diet.,"Little is known about how metabolites couple tissue-specific stem cell function with physiology. Here we show that, in the mammalian small intestine, the expression of Hmgcs2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthetase 2), the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of ketone bodies, including beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), distinguishes self-renewing Lgr5(+) stem cells (ISCs) from differentiated cell types. Hmgcs2 loss depletes betaOHB levels in Lgr5(+) ISCs and skews their differentiation toward secretory cell fates, which can be rescued by exogenous betaOHB and class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor treatment. Mechanistically, betaOHB acts by inhibiting HDACs to reinforce Notch signaling, instructing ISC self-renewal and lineage decisions. Notably, although a high-fat ketogenic diet elevates ISC function and post-injury regeneration through betaOHB-mediated Notch signaling, a glucose-supplemented diet has the opposite effects. These findings reveal how control of betaOHB-activated signaling in ISCs by diet helps to fine-tune stem cell adaptation in homeostasis and injury.",0,C57BL/6J mice; H9C2 cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"protection against Dox toxicity, up",Other / Unspecified,heart,Heart,H9C2 cells,Muscle – Cardiac,Cardiomyoblasts,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Heart failure,Cardiovascular,"protection against Dox toxicity, up","Neuroprotection, up",NS,NS,NS
31581549,Cardioprotective Potential of an SGLT2 Inhibitor Against Doxorubicin-Induced Heart Failure.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have shown that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of heart failure (HF)-associated hospitalization and mortality in patients with diabetes. However, it is not clear whether SGLT2 inhibitors have a cardiovascular benefit in patients without diabetes. We aimed to determine whether empagliflozin (EMPA), an SGLT2 inhibitor, has a protective role in HF without diabetes. METHODS: Cardiomyopathy was induced in C57BL/6J mice using intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (Dox). Mice with HF were fed a normal chow diet (NCD) or an NCD containing 0.03% EMPA. Then we analyzed their phenotypes and performed in vitro experiments to reveal underlying mechanisms of the EMPA's effects. RESULTS: Mice fed NCD with EMPA showed improved heart function and reduced fibrosis. In vitro studies showed similar results. Phloridzin, a non-specific SGLT inhibitor, did not show any protective effect against Dox toxicity in H9C2 cells. SGLT2 inhibitor can cause increase in blood ketone levels. Beta hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), which is well known ketone body associated with SGLT2 inhibitor, showed a protective effect against Dox in H9C2 cells and in Dox-treated mice. These results suggest elevating betaOHB might be a convincing mechanism for the protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: SGLT2 inhibitors have a protective effect in Dox-induced HF in mice. This implied that SGLT2 inhibitor therapy could be a good treatment strategy even in HF patients without diabetes.",0,WAG/Rij (WR) rats; GLUT1 deficiency syndrome mice (GLUT1D); wild type Sprague Dawley rats (SPD),animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Mouse,"circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate increase, up",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"blood glucose, down","Blood glucose, down","KD; 1,3-butanediol (BD); betaHB mineral salt (KS); KS with medium chain triglyceride/MCT (KSMCT); BD acetoacetate diester (KE); KE with MCT (KEMCT); KE with KS (KEKS)","Ketogenic diet (endogenous); 1,3-Butanediol (BD); Ketone salt (KS); Multi-source; Ketone ester (KE)",NS
31599919,Exogenous Ketones Lower Blood Glucose Level in Rested and Exercised Rodent Models.,"Diseases involving inflammation and oxidative stress can be exacerbated by high blood glucose levels. Due to tight metabolic regulation, safely reducing blood glucose can prove difficult. The ketogenic diet (KD) reduces absolute glucose and insulin, while increasing fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, and circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), acetoacetate (AcAc), and acetone. Compliance to KD can be difficult, so alternative therapies that help reduce glucose levels are needed. Exogenous ketones provide an alternative method to elevate blood ketone levels without strict dietary requirements. In this study, we tested the changes in blood glucose and ketone (betaHB) levels in response to acute, sub-chronic, and chronic administration of various ketogenic compounds in either a post-exercise or rested state. WAG/Rij (WR) rats, a rodent model of human absence epilepsy, GLUT1 deficiency syndrome mice (GLUT1D), and wild type Sprague Dawley rats (SPD) were assessed. Non-pathological animals were also assessed across different age ranges. Experimental groups included KD, standard diet (SD) supplemented with water (Control, C) or with exogenous ketones: 1, 3-butanediol (BD), betaHB mineral salt (KS), KS with medium chain triglyceride/MCT (KSMCT), BD acetoacetate diester (KE), KE with MCT (KEMCT), and KE with KS (KEKS). In rested WR rats, the KE, KS, KSMCT groups had lower blood glucose level after 1 h of treatment, and in KE and KSMCT groups after 24 h. After exercise, the KE, KSMCT, KEKS, and KEMCT groups had lowered glucose levels after 1 h, and in the KEKS and KEMCT groups after 7 days, compared to control. In GLUT1D mice without exercise, only KE resulted in significantly lower glucose levels at week 2 and week 6 during a 10 weeks long chronic feeding study. In 4-month and 1-year-old SPD rats in the post-exercise trials, blood glucose was significantly lower in KD and KE, and in KEMCT groups, respectively. After seven days, the KSMCT group had the most significantly reduced blood glucose levels, compared to control. These results indicate that exogenous ketones were efficacious in reducing blood glucose levels within and outside the context of exercise in various rodent models of different ages, with and without pathology.",BDH1; 0; GCG; INS,15 individuals with obesity,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"ketosis, up",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Obesity,Metabolic & Endocrine,"metabolic control, improved","Glycemic control, improved",ketone monoester (KE) drink [(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate; 0.45 mL/kg body weight],Ketone ester (KE); NS,D-BHB
31620022,A ketone monoester drink reduces the glycemic response to an oral glucose challenge in individuals with obesity: a randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: Exogenous ketones make it possible to reach a state of ketosis that may improve metabolic control in humans. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to determine whether the ingestion of a ketone monoester (KE) drink before a 2-h oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) would lower blood glucose concentrations. Secondary objectives were to determine the impact of KE on nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration and glucoregulatory hormones. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled crossover experiment in 15 individuals with obesity (mean +/- SD age: 47 +/- 10 y; BMI: 34 +/- 5 kg/m2). After an overnight fast, participants consumed a KE drink [(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate; 0.45 mL/kg body weight] or taste-matched control drink 30 min before completing a 75-g OGTT. Participants and study personnel performing laboratory analyses were blinded to each condition. RESULTS: The KE increased d-beta-hydroxybutyrate to a maximum of approximately 3.4 mM (P < 0.001) during the OGTT. Compared with the control drink, KE reduced glucose (-11%, P = 0.002), NEFA (-21%, P = 0.009), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (-31%, P = 0.001) areas under the curve (AUCs), whereas glucagon AUC increased (+11%, P = 0.030). No differences in triglyceride, C-peptide, and insulin AUCs were observed after the KE drink. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased and heart rate increased after the KE drink (both P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A KE drink consumed before an OGTT lowered glucose and NEFA AUCs with no increase in circulating insulin. Our results suggest that a single drink of KE may acutely improve metabolic control in individuals with obesity. Future research is warranted to examine whether KE could be used safely to have longer-term effects on metabolic control.

31643037,Central Treatment of Ketone Body in Rainbow Trout Alters Liver Metabolism Without Apparently Altering the Regulation of Food Intake.,"We hypothesize that the presence in fish brain of a ketone body (KB) like beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) alters energy homeostasis through effects on food intake and peripheral energy metabolism. Using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as a model, we intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered 1 mul 100 g(-1) body mass of saline solution alone (control) or containing 0.5 mumol of BHB. In a fist set of experiments, BHB did not affect food intake 6 and 24 h after treatment. In a second set of experiments, we evaluated 6 h after ICV BHB treatment changes in parameters putatively related to food intake control in brain areas (hypothalamus and hindbrain) involved in nutrient sensing and changes in energy metabolism in liver. The absence of changes in food intake might relate to the absence of major changes in the cascade of events from the detection of KB through ketone-sensing mechanisms, changes in transcription factors, and changes in the mRNA abundance of neuropeptides regulating food intake. This response is different than that of mammals. In contrast, central administration of BHB induced changes in liver energy metabolism suggesting a decreased use of glucose and probably an enhanced use of amino acid and lipid. These responses in liver are different to those of mammals under similar treatments but comparable to those occurring in fish under food deprivation conditions.",0,synaptosomes,in vitro,Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"endocytosis, down",Ion & Nutrient Transport,NS,NS,synaptosomes,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,plasma membrane,Plasma Membrane,Unspecified,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Metabolic & Endocrine,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
31648544,High Concentration of Ketone Body beta-Hydroxybutyrate Modifies Synaptic Vesicle Cycle and Depolarizes Plasma Membrane of Rat Brain Synaptosomes.,"Ketoacidosis is a dangerous complication of diabetes mellitus in which plasma levels of ketone bodies can reach 20-25 mM. This condition is life-threatening. In contrast, a ketogenic diet, achieving plasma levels of ketone bodies of about 4-5 mM, can be used for treating different brain diseases. However, the factors leading to the conversion of the neuroprotective ketone bodies' action to the neurotoxic action during ketoacidosis are still unknown. We investigated the influence of high concentration (25 mM) of the main ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), on intrasynaptosomal pH (pHi), synaptic vesicle cycle, plasma membrane, and mitochondrial potentials. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, it was shown that BHB at concentrations of 8 and 25 mM did not influence pHi in synaptosomes. By means of the fluorescent dye acridine orange, it was demonstrated that 25 mM of BHB had no effect on exocytosis but inhibited compensatory endocytosis by 5-fold. Increasing buffer capacity with 25 mM HEPES did not affect endocytosis. Glucose abolished BHB-induced endocytosis inhibition. Using the fluorescent dye DiSC3(5), it was shown that 25 mM of BHB induced a significant plasma membrane depolarization. This effect was not impacted by glucose. Using the fluorescent dye rhodamine-123, it was shown that BHB alone (25 mcapital EM, Cyrillic) did not alter the potential of intrasynaptosomal mitochondria.Importantly, the high concentration of BHB (25 mcapital EM, Cyrillic) causes the depolarization of the plasma membrane and stronger inhibition of endocytosis compared with the intermediate concentration (8 mM).",NTRK1; HDAC1; HDAC2; HDAC3,SH-SY5Y cells; Abeta-treated SH-SY5Y cells,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"HDAC1/3 inhibition, down",Epigenetic Regulation,NS,NS,SH-SY5Y cells,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"neurotoxicity, down","Neuroinflammation, down",endogenous,NS,NS

This study was designed to investigate whether beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), an endogenous histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, upregulates the expression of TrkA by affecting histone acetylation in SH-SY5Y cells treated with amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). The results showed that BHB ameliorated the reduction of cell vitality and downregulation of TrkA expression induced by Abeta. Furthermore, BHB inhibited the upregulation of HDAC1/2/3 expression and downregulation of histone acetylation (Ace-H3K9 and Ace-H4K12) levels in Abeta-treated cells. The expression of TrkA was upregulated in HDAC1- or 3-silenced SH-SY5Y cells. However, there was no significant difference in TrkA expression between the HDAC2 knockdown and control cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that BHB protects against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. The underlying mechanism of the effect may be associated with the upregulation of TrkA expression by inhibiting HDAC1/3.",0,24 healthy adults (18-70 years),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"blood betaHB concentration, up",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"body weight, no-change; body composition, no-change; fasting blood glucose, no-change; cholesterol, no-change; triglyceride, no-change; electrolyte concentrations, no-change; blood gases, no-change; kidney function, no-change","Body weight, no-change; Body composition, no-change; Blood glucose, no-change; Total cholesterol, no-change; Triglycerides, no-change; Electrolyte concentrations, no-change; Blood gases, no-change; Kidney function, no-change","(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (ketone monoester), 25 ml (26.8 g) three times a day for 28 days",Ketone ester (KE),D-BHB
31729600,Safety and tolerability of sustained exogenous ketosis using ketone monoester drinks for 28 days in healthy adults.,"Throughout history, the only way humans could raise their blood ketone levels was by several days of fasting or by following a strict low-carb, high-fat diet. A recently developed, dietary source of ketones, a ketone monoester, elevates d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) to similar concentrations within minutes, with betaHB remaining raised for several hours. To date, the longest human safety study of the exogenous ketone ester was for 5 days, but longer consumption times may be desired. Here we report results for 24 healthy adults, aged 18-70 years, who drank 25 ml (26.8 g) of the ketone monoester, (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate, three times a day for 28 days (a total of 2.1 L). Anthropomorphic measurements, plus fasting blood and urine analyses were made weekly. It was found that elevating blood betaHB concentrations from 0.1 to 4.1 (+/-1.1) mM three times a day for 28 days had no effect on body weights or composition, fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride or electrolyte concentrations, nor blood gases or kidney function, which were invariably normal. Mild nausea was reported following 6 of the 2,016 drinks consumed.

METHODS: A repeated-measures, randomised, crossover study was conducted in nine healthy, trained male cyclists (age, 26.7 +/- 5.2 years; VO(2peak), 63.9 +/- 2.5 mL kg(-1) min(-1)). Participants ingested 0.35 g kg(-1) of BD or placebo 30 min before and 60 min during 85 min of steady-state (SS) exercise, which preceded a ~ 30 min time-trial (TT) (7 kJ kg(-1)). Blood samples were collected at pre-supplement, pre-exercise, post-SS, post-TT and 1-h post-TT. Whole blood cultures were stimulated with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) for 24 h to determine T-cell-related interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10 and interferon (IFN)-gamma mRNA expression within isolated PBMCs in vitro. RESULTS: Serum cortisol, total circulating leukocyte and lymphocyte, and T-cell subset concentrations were similar between trials during exercise and recovery (all p > 0.05). BD ingestion increased T-cell-related IFN-gamma mRNA expression compared with placebo throughout exercise and recovery (p = 0.011); however, IL-4 and IL-10 mRNA expression and the IFN-gamma/IL-4 mRNA expression ratio were unaltered (all p > 0.05).

METHODS: On two occasions in a double-blind, randomized crossover design, eight endurance-trained runners performed 1 h of submaximal exercise at approximately 65% V O2max immediately followed by a 10-km self-paced time trial (TT) on a motorized treadmill. An 8% carbohydrate-electrolyte solution was consumed before and during exercise, either alone (CHO + PLA), or with 573 mg.kg of a ketone monoester supplement (CHO + KME). Expired air, HR, and RPE were monitored during submaximal exercise. Serial venous blood samples were assayed for plasma glucose, lactate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. RESULTS: CHO + KME produced plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations of approximately 1.0 to 1.3 mM during exercise (P < 0.001), but plasma glucose and lactate concentrations were similar during exercise in both trials. V O2, running economy, respiratory exchange ratio, HR, and RPE were also similar between trials. Performance in the 10-km TT was not different (P = 0.483) between CHO + KME (mean, 2402 s; 95% confidence interval, 2204-2600 s) and CHO + PLA (mean, 2422 s; 95% confidence interval, 2217-2628 s). Cognitive performance, measured by reaction time and a multitasking test, did not differ between trials.

31751935,Dietary Supplementation With the Ketogenic Diet Metabolite Beta-Hydroxybutyrate Ameliorates Post-TBI Aggression in Young-Adult Male Drosophila.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI), caused by repeated concussive head trauma can induce chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease featuring behavioral symptoms ranging from cognitive deficits to elevated aggression. In a Drosophila model, we used a high-impact trauma device (Katzenberger et al., 2013, 2015) to induce TBI-like symptoms and to study post-TBI behavioral outcomes. Following TBI, aggression in banged male flies was significantly elevated as compared with that in unbanged flies. These increases in aggressive behavior were not the result of basal motility changes, as measured by a negative geotaxis assay. In addition, the increase in post-TBI aggression appeared to be specific to concussive trauma: neither cold exposure nor electric shock-two alternate types of trauma-significantly elevated aggressive behavior in male-male pairs. Various forms of dietary therapy, especially the high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD), have recently been explored for a wide variety of neuropathies. We thus hypothesized that putatively neuroprotective dietary interventions might be able to suppress post-traumatic elevations in aggressive behavior in animals subjected to head-trauma-inducing strikes, or ""bangs"". We supplemented a normal high-carbohydrate Drosophila diet with the KD metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB)-a ketone body (KB). Banged flies raised on a KB-supplemented diet exhibited a marked reduction in aggression, whereas aggression in unbanged flies was equivalent whether dieted with KB supplements or not. Pharmacological blockade of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel abrogated KB effects reducing post-TBI aggression while pharmacological activation mimicked them, suggesting a mechanism by which KBs act in this model. KBs did not significantly extend lifespan in banged flies, but markedly extended lifespan in unbanged flies. We have thus developed a functional model for the study of post-TBI elevations of aggression. Further, we conclude that dietary interventions may be a fruitful avenue for further exploration of treatments for TBI- and CTE-related cognitive-behavioral symptoms.",0,healthy college-aged males,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"elevation of blood beta-OHB, up",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cognitive performance, no-change","Cognitive performance, no-change",commercially available racemic (D- and L-)beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) KS (0.38 g/kg body mass),Multi-source,racemic

Following a peak oxygen uptake test and DSC familiarization, 16 males completed a DSC while cycling at 60% of their respective peak oxygen uptake after ingesting either a commercially available racemic (D- and L-)beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) KS (0.38 g/kg body mass) or a placebo, using a triple-blinded, crossover, and counterbalanced design. The participants consumed the KS or placebo at -60 and -15 min prior to the start of the DSC. Heart rate, rating of perceived exertion, and blood beta-OHB and glucose were sampled throughout. The DSC consisted of a mental arithmetic challenge and a modified Stroop Color Word, which alternated every 2 min for 20 min. Upon completion of the DSC, responses for correct, incorrect, and no responses were recorded for the mental arithmetic challenge and Stroop Color Word. Blood beta-OHB was elevated with KS by -15 min and remained so throughout (p < .001), peaking at 0.76 +/- 0.32 mM. Blood glucose was lower with KS compared with the placebo at -15 and 10 min by 9% and 5%, respectively (both ps < .05). There were no differences between the treatments for heart rate, rating of perceived exertion, mental arithmetic challenge, or Stroop Color Word. Overall, this study suggests that KSs are not effective aids for enhancing cognitive performance during a DSC, which might partially be explained by the inability of currently available commercial KS supplements to elevate beta-OHB blood concentrations above approximately 1.0 mM.",0; KCNQ3,mice; PTZ seizure assay; in vitro KCNQ2/3 channel assays,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"KCNQ2/3 channel activation, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,nervous system,NS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"seizure activity, down","Seizure activity, down",primary ketone body generated by ketosis,NS,NS
31821157,M-Channel Activation Contributes to the Anticonvulsant Action of the Ketone Body beta-Hydroxybutyrate.,"Ketogenic diets are effective therapies for refractory epilepsy, yet the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. The anticonvulsant efficacy of ketogenic diets correlates positively to the serum concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the primary ketone body generated by ketosis. Voltage-gated potassium channels generated by KCNQ2-5 subunits, especially KCNQ2/3 heteromers, generate the M-current, a therapeutic target for synthetic anticonvulsants. Here, we report that BHB directly activates KCNQ2/3 channels (EC(50) = 0.7 microM), via a highly conserved S5 tryptophan (W265) on KCNQ3. BHB was also acutely effective as an anticonvulsant in the pentylene tetrazole (PTZ) seizure assay in mice. Strikingly, coadministration of gamma-amino-beta-hydroxybutyric acid, a high-affinity KCNQ2/3 partial agonist that also acts via KCNQ3-W265, similarly reduced the efficacy of BHB in KCNQ2/3 channel activation in vitro and in the PTZ seizure assay in vivo. Our results uncover a novel, unexpected molecular basis for anticonvulsant effects of the major ketone body induced by ketosis. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Ketogenic diets are used to treat refractory epilepsy but the therapeutic mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we show that clinically relevant concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate, the primary ketone body generated during ketogenesis, activates KCNQ2/3 potassium channels by binding to a specific site on KCNQ3, an effect known to reduce neuronal excitability. We provide evidence using a mouse chemoconvulsant model that KCNQ2/3 activation contributes to the antiepileptic action of beta-hydroxybutyrate.",0,18 patients with type 2 diabetes,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,brain,Brain/CNS,neurones,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Type 2 diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"working memory, up; global cognitive performance, no-change","Memory (general), up; Cognitive performance, no-change",i.v. ketone body (beta-hydroxybutyrate) infusion,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Providing a glucose substitute such as ketone bodies might restore metabolic balance in glucose-compromised neurones and improve cognitive performance. We aimed to investigate if beta-hydroxybutyrate (ketone body) infusion acutely affects cognitive performance, measured by a neuropsychological test battery, in patients with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over trial. METHODS: Eighteen patients with type 2 diabetes received i.v. ketone body (beta-hydroxybutyrate) and placebo (saline) infusion in a randomised order on two separate occasions. On both days of examination, blood glucose was clamped at 7.5 mmol/L and a neuropsychological test battery was used to assess global cognitive performance (primary outcome) and specialized cognitive measures of verbal memory, working memory, executive function, psychomotor speed, and sustained attention. RESULTS: During neurocognitive testing, beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were 2.4 vs 0.1 mmol/L. Working memory assessed by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale letter-number-sequencing significantly improved by 1.6 points (95% CI: 0.7, 2.4; non-adjusted P < 0.001) corresponding to a 17% increase in performance during ketone infusion compared to placebo. There was no change for global cognitive performance or any other cognitive measure after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Blood concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate and glycaemic status did not associate with test performance; however, insulin resistance measured by HOMA was related to improved working memory performance during ketone infusion (beta = 4%; 95% CI: 1.1, 7.7; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Ketone infusion specifically improved working memory performance in patients with type 2 diabetes in the absence of changes in global cognition.",0,"cecal ligation and perforation-induced sepsis model; sepsis mice; coculture of neurons, astrocytes, and BV2 cells",animal; in vitro,Multi-model; Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"neuroinflammation, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,microglia,Neural / Glial,Microglia,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Sepsis,Infectious,"cognition (learning and memory), up; survival, up; body weight recovery, up","Cognition, up; Survival, up; Body weight, up",subcutaneous administration; intracerebroventricular administration,NS,NS
31871320,Subcutaneous administration of beta-hydroxybutyrate improves learning and memory of sepsis surviving mice.,"Post-sepsis cognitive impairment is one of the major sequelae in sepsis survivors. Its prevention remains clinically challenging. Here we tested the effects and underlying mechanisms of exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on post-sepsis cognitive impairment. We found that subcutaneous administration of BHB increased survival and body weight recovery of sepsis mice and improved learning and memory of sepsis surviving mice in a cecal ligation and perforation-induced sepsis model. Additionally, the improvement of learning and memory of sepsis surviving mice was still detected even if BHB was administrated at the late stage of sepsis. In contrast, glucose solution did not show similar effects. Mechanistically, subcutaneous administration of BHB increased the BHB level of hippocampus, and limited neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity damage in sepsis mice. Intracerebroventricular administration of BHB also alleviated neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment of sepsis surviving mice. In the coculture of neurons, astrocytes, and BV2 cells (a microglial cell line), knocking down the expression of microglial HCA2 (BHB receptor) via a specific shRNA reduced the protection of BHB to lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response and neuron damage more significantly than knocking down neuronal MCT2 (BHB transporter). These data showed that (1) BHB was a potential pharmacological adjunct treatment for prevention of post-sepsis cognitive impairment and (2) inhibiting neuroinflammation via HCA2 was an important mechanism.",FOXO1; PPARGC1A; PCK1,NS,NS,NS,"beta-hydroxybutyrylation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,NS,NS,CD8(+) T(mem) cells,Hematopoietic / Immune,T cells,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketogenesis-derived beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
31895061,Ketogenesis-generated beta-hydroxybutyrate is an epigenetic regulator of CD8(+) T-cell memory development.,"Glycogen has long been considered to have a function in energy metabolism. However, our recent study indicated that glycogen metabolism, directed by cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase Pck1, controls the formation and maintenance of CD8(+) memory T (T(mem)) cells by regulating redox homeostasis(1). This unusual metabolic program raises the question of how Pck1 is upregulated in CD8(+) T(mem) cells. Here, we show that mitochondrial acetyl coenzyme A is diverted to the ketogenesis pathway, which indirectly regulates Pck1 expression. Mechanistically, ketogenesis-derived beta-hydroxybutyrate is present in CD8(+) T(mem) cells; beta-hydroxybutyrate epigenetically modifies Lys 9 of histone H3 (H3K9) of Foxo1 and Ppargc1a (which encodes PGC-1alpha) with beta-hydroxybutyrylation, upregulating the expression of these genes. As a result, FoxO1 and PGC-1alpha cooperatively upregulate Pck1 expression, therefore directing the carbon flow along the gluconeogenic pathway to glycogen and the pentose phosphate pathway. These results reveal that ketogenesis acts as an unusual metabolic pathway in CD8(+) T(mem) cells, linking epigenetic modification required for memory development.",0,mice; stress-naive mice; chronic unpredictable stress mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"antidepressant activity, up",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Major depressive disorder,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"immobility time, down","Depressive-like behavior, down",NS,NS,NS
31918761,Evaluation of the antidepressive property of beta-hydroxybutyrate in mice.,"beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body metabolite, has been shown to suppress depression-like behavior in rodents. In this study, we examined its antidepressive property in acute and chronic administration modes in mice by using forced swim test and tail suspension test. Results showed that the decrease effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate (300 mg/kg) on immobility time in the tail suspension test and forced swim test in stress-naive mice began to be significant at day 11. In a dose-dependent experiment, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment (11 days) showed significant antidepressant activities at the dose of 200 and 300 mg/kg. Unlike fluoxetine, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment (300 mg/kg) showed no antidepressant activities in the acute (1 hour before the test) and three times administration mode within 24 hours (1, 5, and 24 hours before the test). But in a co-administration mode, beta-hydroxybutyrate (100 mg/kg) -fluoxetine (2.5 mg/kg) co-administration exhibited an obvious antidepressant activity in the tail suspension test and forced swim test. Further analysis showed that the antidepressant effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate and fluoxetine were not associated with the change in mouse locomotor activity. Furthermore, both chronic beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment and beta-hydroxybutyrate-fluoxetine co-treatment suppressed chronic unpredictable stress-induced increase in immobility time in the tail suspension test and forced swim test as well as chronic unpredictable stress-induced decrease in mouse body weight. Taken together, these results indicate that beta-hydroxybutyrate (1) needs a relatively long time to show comparable behavioral activity to that of fluoxetine in assays that are sensitive to the behavioral effects of established antidepressant compounds and (2) can augment the antidepressant action of a sub-therapeutic dose of fluoxetine.",0,patients with Angelman syndrome,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"ketosis, up",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Angelman syndrome,Genetic / Congenital,"nutritional status, NS","Nutritional status, NS",exogenous ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Cognition, mobility, sleep, and gastrointestinal health are intrinsically linked to seizure activity and overall quality of life. Ketogenic and low-glycemic diets restrict carbohydrate consumption and stabilize blood glucose levels. The ketogenic diet induces ketosis, a metabolic state where ketone bodies are preferentially used for fuel. The use of exogenous ketones in promoting ketosis in Angelman syndrome has not been previously studied. The study formulation evaluated herein contains the exogenous ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate to rapidly shift the body towards ketosis, resulting in enhanced metabolic efficiency. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to assess the safety and tolerability of a nutritional formula containing exogenous ketones. It also examines the potential for exogenous ketones to improve the patient's nutritional status which can impact the physiologic, symptomatic, and health outcome liabilities of living with Angelman syndrome. DISCUSSION: This manuscript outlines the rationale for a study designed to be the first to provide data on nutritional approaches for patients with Angelman syndrome using exogenous ketones.

We hypothesised that ingestion of a ketone ester (KE) drink prior to exercise could serve as an alternative oxidative substrate supply to boost muscular ATP homeostasis. To establish a rational basis for therapeutic use of KE supplementation in FAO, we tested this hypothesis in patients deficient in Very Long-Chain acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase (VLCAD). Five patients (range 17-45 y; 4 M/1F) patients were included in an investigator-initiated, randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled, 2-way cross-over study. Patients drank either a KE + CHO mix or an isocaloric CHO equivalent and performed 35 minutes upright cycling followed by 10 minutes supine cycling inside a Magnetic Resonance scanner at individual maximal FAO work rate (fatmax; approximately 40% VO(2) max). The protocol was repeated after a 1-week interval with the alternate drink. Primary outcome measures were quadriceps phosphocreatine (PCr), Pi and pH dynamics during exercise and recovery assayed by in vivo (31) P-MR spectroscopy. Secondary outcomes included plasma and muscle metabolites and respiratory gas exchange recordings. Ingestion of KE rapidly induced mild ketosis and increased muscle BHB content. During exercise at FATMAX, VLCADD-specific plasma acylcarnitine levels, quadriceps glycolytic intermediate levels and in vivo Pi/PCr ratio were all lower in KE + CHO than CHO. These results provide a rational basis for future clinical trials of synthetic ketone ester supplementation therapy in patients with FAO disorders. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov.

31978481,Treatment with the Ketone Body D-beta-hydroxybutyrate Attenuates Autophagy Activated by NMDA and Reduces Excitotoxic Neuronal Damage in the Rat Striatum In Vivo.,"BACKGROUND: The ketone bodies (KB), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate, have been proposed for the treatment of acute and chronic neurological disorders, however, the molecular mechanisms involved in KB protection are not well understood. KB can substitute for glucose and support mitochondrial metabolism increasing cell survival. We have reported that the D-isomer of BHB (D-BHB) stimulates autophagic degradation during glucose deprivation in cultured neurons increasing cell viability. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation process of damaged proteins and organelles activated during nutrient deprivation to obtain building blocks and energy. However, impaired or excessive autophagy can contribute to neuronal death. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to test whether D-BHB can preserve autophagic function in an in vivo model of excitotoxic damage induced by the administration of the glutamate receptor agonist, N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA), in the rat striatum. METHODS: D-BHB was administered through an intravenous injection followed by either an intraperitoneal injection (i.v+i.p) or a continuous epidural infusion (i.v+pump), or through a continuous infusion of D-BHB alone. Changes in the autophagy proteins ATG7, ATG5, BECLIN 1 (BECN1), LC3, Sequestrosome1/p62 (SQSTM1/ p62) and the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2, were evaluated by immunoblot. The lesion volume was measured in cresyl violet-stained brain sections. RESULTS: Autophagy is activated early after NMDA injection but autophagic degradation is impaired due to the cleavage of LAMP2. Twenty-four h after NMDA intrastriatal injection, the autophagic flux is re-established, but LAMP2 cleavage is still observed. The administration of D-BHB through the i.v+pump protocol reduced the content of autophagic proteins and the cleavage of LAMP2, suggesting decreased autophagosome formation and lysosomal membrane preservation, improving autophagic degradation. D-BHB also reduced brain injury. The i.v+i.p administration protocol and the infusion of D-BHB alone showed no effect on autophagy activation or degradation.",AGER,human Carbonic anhydrase II,in vitro,NS,"glycation, down",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

This reaction leads to changes in structure and functions of proteins in which the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are the final outcome and cause many complications in diabetic patients. We herein examined the effect of fasting on the glycation process of human Carbonic anhydrase II under physiological conditions (37 degrees C and pH 7.4) employing various techniques, including Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and CD Spectroscopy. We found an increased 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate upon fasting. We studied various samples of control carbonic anhydrase (without glucose and 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate), carbonic anhydrase with glucose, carbonic anhydrase treated with 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and carbonic anhydrase along with glucose and 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate. The samples were incubated for 35 days under physiological conditions. Our results indicated that 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibited the glycation process, decreased glucose binding to the protein, prevented the formation of AGEs, and modified the enzyme activity. Our findings would open new windows toward the enzymatic procedure which would have profound implication in understanding the diabetes mechanisms.",0,Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"A1 receptor-mediated signaling, NS",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"onset of isoflurane-induced anesthesia (time until immobility), up","Anesthesia onset time, up",KE; KS; KEKS; KSMCT; KEMCT,Ketone ester (KE); Ketone salt (KS); Multi-source,NS
32023814,Inhibition of adenosine A1 receptors abolished the nutritional ketosis-evoked delay in the onset of isoflurane-induced anesthesia in Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk rats.,"BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that administration of exogenous ketone supplement ketone salt (KS) and ketone ester (KE) increased blood ketone level and delayed the onset of isoflurane-induced anesthesia in different rodent models, such as Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats. The modulatory effect of adenosinergic system may have a role in the ketone supplementation-evoked effects on isoflurane-generated anesthesia. Thus, we investigated whether adenosine receptor antagonists can modulate the effect of exogenous ketone supplements on the onset of akinesia induced by isoflurane. METHODS: To investigate the effect of exogenous ketone supplements on anesthetic induction we used ketone supplement KE, KS, KEKS (1:1 mix of KE and KS), KSMCT and KEMCT (1:1 mix of KS and KE with medium chain triglyceride/MCT oil, respectively) in WAG/Rij rats. Animals were fed with standard diet (SD), which was supplemented by oral gavage of different ketone supplements (2.5 g/kg/day) for 1 week. After 7 days, isoflurane (3%) was administered for 5 min and the time until onset of isoflurane-induced anesthesia (time until immobility; light phase of anesthesia: loss of consciousness without movement) was measured. Changes in levels of blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), blood glucose and body weight of animals were also recorded. To investigate the putative effects of adenosine receptors on ketone supplements-evoked influence on isoflurane-induced anesthesia we used a specific adenosine A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX (intraperitoneally/i.p. 0.2 mg/kg) and a selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist SCH 58261 (i.p. 0.5 mg/kg) alone as well as in combination with KEKS. RESULTS: Significant increases were demonstrated in both blood betaHB levels and the number of seconds required before isoflurane-induced anesthesia (immobility) after the final treatment by all exogenous ketone supplements. Moreover, this effect of exogenous ketone supplements positively correlated with blood betaHB levels. It was also demonstrated that DPCPX completely abolished the effect of KEKS on isoflurane-induced anesthesia (time until immobility), but not SCH 58261. CONCLUSIONS: These findings strengthen our previous suggestion that exogenous ketone supplements may modulate the isoflurane-induced onset of anesthesia (immobility), likely through A1Rs.",SLC16A1; SLC2A1; LRP1; ABCB1; PICALM,brain-like endothelial cells (BLECs),human; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"LRP1- and P-gp-mediated Abeta efflux, up",Multiple mechanisms,blood-brain barrier,Blood,brain-like endothelial cells (BLECs),Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"Abeta efflux, up","Abeta efflux, up",NS,NS,NS

The pathological process has not yet been clarified, although dysfunctional transport of Abeta across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) appears to be integral to disease development. At present, no effective therapeutic treatment against AD exists, and the adoption of a ketogenic diet (KD) or ketone body (KB) supplements have been investigated as potential new therapeutic approaches. Despite experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that KBs reduce the Abeta load in the AD brain, little information is available about the effect of KBs on BBB and their effect on Abeta transport. Therefore, we used a human in vitro BBB model, brain-like endothelial cells (BLECs), to investigate the effect of KBs on the BBB and on Abeta transport. Our results show that KBs do not modify BBB integrity and do not cause toxicity to BLECs. Furthermore, the presence of KBs in the culture media was combined with higher MCT1 and GLUT1 protein levels in BLECs. In addition, KBs significantly enhanced the protein levels of LRP1, P-gp, and PICALM, described to be involved in Abeta clearance. Finally, the combined use of KBs promotes Abeta efflux across the BBB. Inhibition experiments demonstrated the involvement of LRP1 and P-gp in the efflux. This work provides evidence that KBs promote Abeta clearance from the brain to blood in addition to exciting perspectives for studying the use of KBs in therapeutic approaches.",PDHA1,3xTgAd mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"TCA cycle metabolites restoration, up",Metabolic Regulation,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"exploratory activity, up; avoidance-related behavior, down","Locomotor activity, up; Anxiety-like behavior, down",ketone ester of d-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Multi-source,D-BHB
32045881,A Dietary Ketone Ester Normalizes Abnormal Behavior in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Because of a decreased sensitivity toward insulin, a key regulator of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), Alzheimer's patients have lower brain glucose utilization with reductions in Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle metabolites such as citrate, a precursor to n-acetyl-aspartate. In the 3xTgAd mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), aging mice also demonstrate low brain glucose metabolism. Ketone metabolism can overcome PDH inhibition and restore TCA cycle metabolites, thereby enhancing amino acid biosynthesis. A ketone ester of d-beta-hydroxybutyrate was incorporated into a diet (Ket) and fed to 3xTgAd mice. A control group was fed a calorically matched diet (Cho). At 15 months of age, the exploratory and avoidance-related behavior patterns of the mice were evaluated. At 16.5 months of age, the animals were euthanized, and their hippocampi were analyzed for citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and amino acids. In the hippocampi of the Ket-fed mice, there were higher concentrations of citrate and alpha-ketoglutarate as well as higher concentrations of glutamate, aspartate and n-acetyl-aspartate compared with controls. There were positive associations between (1) concentrations of aspartate and n-acetyl-aspartate (n = 14, R = 0.9327), and (2) alpha-ketoglutarate and glutamate (n = 14, R = 0.8521) in animals maintained on either diet. Hippocampal n-acetyl-aspartate predicted the outcome of several exploratory and avoidance-related behaviors. Ketosis restored citrate and alpha-ketoglutarate in the hippocampi of aging mice.

32069870,Acute Ketone Supplementation and Exercise Performance: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"PURPOSE: To determine the acute effects of ketone supplementation on exercise performance (primary outcome) and physiological and perceptual responses to exercise (secondary outcomes). METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus (since inception to July 21, 2019) to find randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of acute ketone supplementation compared with a drink containing no ketones (ie, control intervention). The standardized mean difference (Hedges g) between interventions and 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met all inclusion criteria. No significant differences were observed between interventions for overall exercise performance (Hedges g = -0.05; 95% CI, -0.30 to 0.20; P = .68). Subanalyses revealed no differences between interventions when analyzing endurance time-trial performance (g = -0.04; 95% CI, -0.35 to 0.28; P = .82) or when assessing the separate effects of supplements containing ketone esters (g = -0.07; 95% CI, -0.38 to 0.24; P = .66) or salts (g = -0.02; 95% CI, -0.45 to 0.41; P = .93). All studies reported increases in plasma ketone concentration after acute ketone supplementation, but no consistent effects were reported on the metabolic (plasma lactate and glucose levels), respiratory (respiratory exchange ratio, oxygen uptake, and ventilatory rate), cardiovascular (heart rate), or perceptual responses to exercise (rating of perceived exertion). CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that ketone supplementation exerts no clear influence on exercise performance (from sprints to events lasting up to approximately 50 min) or metabolic, respiratory, cardiovascular, or perceptual responses to exercise. More research is needed to elucidate if this strategy could provide ergogenic effects on other exercise types (eg, ultraendurance exercise).",APOE; CD68; IGHG1; RETN; APP,ApoE-deficient mice (high-fat diet); ChP mice cell line,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse,"anti-inflammatory activity, up",Inflammation & Immune Response,brain,Brain/CNS,macroglia,Neural / Glial,Astrocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease; Atherosclerosis,Neurodegenerative; Cardiovascular,"amyloid plaque, down; aortic plaque formation, down","Amyloid plaque, down; Atherosclerosis, down",NS,NS,NS

Apolipoprotein-E (ApoE) is strongly associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effect of beta-OHB in the brain and the aorta of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed ApoE-deficient mice. We found in Apo-E deficient mice that beta-OHB attenuated lipid deposition in the choroid plexus (ChP) and decreased amyloid plaque in the substantia nigra pars compacta. We also found decreased CD68-positive macroglia infiltration of the ChP in beta-OHB-treated ApoE-deficient mice. beta-OHB treatment ameliorated IgG extravasation into the hippocampal region of the brain. In vitro study using ChP mice cell line revealed that beta-OHB attenuated oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced ApoE-specific differentially expressed inflammatory ChP genes. Treatment with beta-OHB reduced aortic plaque formation without affecting blood lipid profiles and decreased serum production of resistin, a well-established risk factor for both AD and atherosclerosis. Thus, the current study suggests and describes the therapeutic potential of beta-OHB for the treatment of AD and atherosclerosis.",0; AACS,ventilated critically ill patients with acute brain injury; stroke; subarachnoid haemorrhage; traumatic brain injury,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"ketosis induction, up",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Acute brain injury,Injury & Trauma,"cerebral hemodynamics, no-change","Cerebral hemodynamics, no-change",enterally administered ketogenic formulation,NS,NS

The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and safety of inducing ketosis using an enteric ketogenic formulation and determine its impact on intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressures and metabolic parameters.Methods: Prospective interventional Phase II trial of ventilated critically ill patients with acute brain injury administered a ketogenic feed over a 6 day period.Results: 20 patients were recruited, 5 females and 15 males, 3 with stroke, 2 with subarachnoid haemorrhage and 15 with traumatic brain injury. Feeds were well tolerated with 19 patients completing study. There was a significant increase in both plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate from 0.24+/- 0.31 mmol/l and 0.19 +/- 0.16 mmol/l to 0.61 +/- 0.53 mmol/l (p =0.0005) and 0.52 +/- 0.40 mmol/l (p<0.0001) respectively over the 6 day period. Total daily Ketocal(R) caloric intake was positively correlated with plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations (p=0.0011). There was no significant correlation between the cerebral hypertension and cerebral hypoperfusion indices and plasma ketone concentrations. In 95% of patients there were no clinically significant changes in acid/base status over the 6 days with pH remaining within normal range.Conclusion: In patients with acute brain injury, an enterally administered ketogenic formulation increased plasma ketone concentrations, was well tolerated, did not impact on cerebral hemodynamics and can be safely administered.Clinical trial registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12616000332426)Abbreviations: BHB: betahydroxybutyrate; AcAc: acetoacetate; ABI: acute brain injury; TBI: traumatic brain injury; CSF: cerebrospinal fluid; SAH: subarachnoid injury; CVA: cerebrovascular accidents; ICP: intracranial pressure; CPP: cerebral perfusion pressure; ICU: intensive care unit; EVD: external ventricular device; CHI: cerebral hypoperfusion index; IHI: intracranial hypertension index; GCS: Glasgow Coma Scale.",0,n=292 (ages 20 to 85 y); n=636 (ages 18 to 88 y); 42 adults (50 y); overnight fasted cohort scanned before and after glucose and exogenous ketone ester bolus,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"Gibbs free energy change for ATP, up",Other / Unspecified,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"network stability, up","Network stability, up",ketogenic diet; exogenous ketone ester (d-beta-hydroxybutyrate) bolus,Ketogenic diet (endogenous); Multi-source,D-BHB

As cellular inputs, ketones increase Gibbs free energy change for ATP by 27% compared to glucose. Here we test whether dietary changes are capable of modulating sustained functional communication between brain regions (network stability) by changing their predominant dietary fuel from glucose to ketones. We first established network stability as a biomarker for brain aging using two large-scale (n = 292, ages 20 to 85 y; n = 636, ages 18 to 88 y) 3 T functional MRI (fMRI) datasets. To determine whether diet can influence brain network stability, we additionally scanned 42 adults, age < 50 y, using ultrahigh-field (7 T) ultrafast (802 ms) fMRI optimized for single-participant-level detection sensitivity. One cohort was scanned under standard diet, overnight fasting, and ketogenic diet conditions. To isolate the impact of fuel type, an independent overnight fasted cohort was scanned before and after administration of a calorie-matched glucose and exogenous ketone ester (d-beta-hydroxybutyrate) bolus. Across the life span, brain network destabilization correlated with decreased brain activity and cognitive acuity. Effects emerged at 47 y, with the most rapid degeneration occurring at 60 y. Networks were destabilized by glucose and stabilized by ketones, irrespective of whether ketosis was achieved with a ketogenic diet or exogenous ketone ester. Together, our results suggest that brain network destabilization may reflect early signs of hypometabolism, associated with dementia.

32247790,The Impact of Acute Ingestion of a Ketone Monoester Drink on LPS-Stimulated NLRP3 Activation in Humans with Obesity.,"Activation of the NOD-like receptor pyrin-domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation in metabolic diseases such as obesity. Mechanistic studies have shown that beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHB) attenuates activation of NLRP3, but human data are limited. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial (n = 11) we tested the hypothesis that acutely raising beta-OHB by ingestion of exogenous ketones would attenuate NLRP3 activation in humans with obesity. Blood was sampled before and 30 min post-ingestion of a ketone monoester drink ((R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate, 482 mg/kg body mass) or placebo. A 75 g oral glucose load was then ingested, and a third blood sample was obtained 60 min following glucose ingestion. NLRP3 activation was quantified by assessing monocyte caspase-1 activation and interleukin (IL)-1beta secretion in ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated whole-blood cultures. LPS-stimulated caspase-1 activation increased following glucose ingestion (main effect of time; p = 0.032), with no differences between conditions. IL-1beta secretion did not differ between conditions but was lower 60 min post-glucose ingestion compared to the fasting baseline (main effect of time, p = 0.014). Plasma IL-1beta was detectable in ~80% of samples and showed a decrease from fasting baseline to 60 min in the ketone condition only (condition x time interaction, p = 0.01). In individuals with obesity, an excursion into hyperglycemia following ingestion of a glucose load augments LPS-induced activation of caspase-1 in monocytes with no apparent impact of raising circulating beta-OHB concentration via ingestion of exogenous ketones. Exogenous ketone supplementation may impact plasma IL-1beta, but these findings require confirmation in studies with larger sample sizes.",0,Sprague Dawley rats; controlled cortical impact (CCI),animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Other Mammal,"mitochondrial function, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,peri-contusional cortex,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Traumatic brain injury,Injury & Trauma,"NS, nan","NS, nan",infused i.v.,Intravenous BHB,NS
32248292,Alternative substrate metabolism depends on cerebral metabolic state following traumatic brain injury.,"Decreases in energy metabolism following traumatic brain injury (TBI) are attributed to impairment of glycolytic flux and oxidative phosphorylation. Glucose utilization post-TBI is decreased while administration of alternative substrates has been shown to be neuroprotective. Changes in energy metabolism following TBI happens in two phases; a period of hyper-metabolism followed by prolonged hypo-metabolism. It is not understood how different cerebral metabolic states may impact substrate metabolism and ultimately mitochondrial function. Adult male or female Sprague Dawley rats were given sham surgery or controlled cortical impact (CCI) and were assigned one of two administration schemes. Glucose, lactate or beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) were infused i.v. either starting immediately after injury or beginning 6 h post-injury for 3 h to reflect the hyper- and hypo-metabolic stages. Animals were euthanized 24 h post-injury. The peri-contusional cortex was collected and assayed for mitochondrial respiration peroxide production, and citrate synthase activity. Tissue acetyl-CoA, ATP, glycogen and HMGB1 were also quantified. Sex differences were observed in injury pattern. Administration based on cerebral metabolic state identified that only early lactate and late BHB improved mitochondrial function and peroxide production and TCA cycle intermediates in males. In contrast, both early and late BHB had deleterious effects on all aspects of metabolic measurements in females. These data stress there is no one optimal alternative substrate, but rather the fuel type used should be guided by both cerebral metabolic state and sex.",PYY; GHRL; BDH1,healthy weight participants; participants with overweight/obesity,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"gastric emptying, down",Metabolic Regulation,stomach,Stomach,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"energy intake, down","Food intake, down",MCT oil,MCT / Medium-chain fats,NS
32269653,A comparison of the satiating properties of medium-chain triglycerides and conjugated linoleic acid in participants with healthy weight and overweight or obesity.,"PURPOSE: Inconsistent evidence exists for greater satiety after medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) or conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) compared to long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Furthermore, the mechanisms are poorly understood and effects in people with a healthy weight and those with overweight/obesity have not been compared. This study aimed to compare appetite responses in these groups and examine the mechanisms behind any differences. METHODS: Fifteen participants with healthy weight (BMI: 22.7 +/- 1.9 kg.m(-2)) and fourteen participants with overweight/obesity (BMI: 30.9 +/- 3.9 kg.m(-2)) consumed a breakfast containing either 23.06 g vegetable oil (CON), 25.00 g MCT oil (MCT), or 6.25 g CLA and 16.80 g vegetable oil (CLA). Appetite, peptide YY (PYY), total ghrelin (TG), beta-hydroxybutyrate, and gastric emptying (GE) were measured throughout. Energy intake was assessed at an ad libitum lunch and throughout the following ~ 36 h. RESULTS: Neither MCT nor CLA decreased ad libitum intake; however MCT decreased day 1 energy intake (P = 0.031) and the 48-h period (P = 0.005) compared to CON. MCT delayed GE (P </= 0.01) compared to CON, whereas CLA did not. PYY and TG concentrations were not different (P = 0.743 and P = 0.188, respectively), but MCT increased beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations compared to CON (P = 0.005) and CLA (P < 0.001). beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were higher in participants with overweight/obesity (P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Consumption of MCT reduces energy intake in the subsequent 48 h, whereas CLA does not. Delayed gastric emptying or increased beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations may mediate this.",0,recreational endurance runners (n = 10; age: 20.8 +/- 1.0 years; body mass: 68.9 +/- 5.6 kg; height: 175.6 +/- 4.9 cm),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"plasma R-betaHB increase, up",Metabolic Regulation,plasma,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"5-km running time, no-change","Exercise capacity, no-change",oral beta-hydroxybutyrate-salt + Medium Chain Triglyceride (betaHB-salt+MCT) ketone supplement,MCT / Medium-chain fats,D-BHB

The purpose of this study was to assess exercise performance time and related physiological, metabolic and perceptual responses of recreational endurance runners after ingestion of a commercially available oral ketone supplement. Recreational endurance runners (n = 10; age: 20.8 +/- 1.0 years; body mass: 68.9 +/- 5.6 kg; height: 175.6 +/- 4.9 cm) participated in a double-blind, crossover, repeated-measures study where they were randomized to 300 mg.kg-1 body weight of an oral beta-hydroxybutyrate-salt + Medium Chain Triglyceride (betaHB-salt+MCT) ketone supplement or a flavor matched placebo (PLA) 60 min prior to performing a 5-km running time trial (5KTT) on a treadmill. Time, HR, RPE, affect, RER, VO(2), VCO(2), and VE were measured during the 5-km run. The Session RPE and affect (Feeling Scale) were obtained post-5KTT. Plasma glucose, lactate and ketones were measured at baseline, 60-min post-supplement, and immediately post-5KTT. Plasma R-betaHB (endogenous isomer) was elevated from baseline and throughout the entire protocol under the betaHB-salt+MCT condition (p < 0.05). No significant difference (58.3 +/- 100.40 s; 95% CI: -130.12 - 13.52; p = 0.100) was observed between the betaHB-salt+MCT supplement (1430.0 +/- 187.7 s) and the PLA (1488.3 +/- 243.8 s) in time to complete the 5KTT.

Preclinical studies have shown that the immature rat brain is more resilient to HI injury, suggesting innate mechanisms of neuroprotection. During neonatal period brain metabolism experience changes that might greatly affect the outcome of HI injury. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate how changes in brain metabolism interfere with HI outcome in different stages of CNS development. For this purpose, animals were divided into 6 groups: HIP3, HIP7 and HIP11 (HI performed at postnatal days 3, 7 and 11, respectively), and their respective shams. In vivo [(18)F]FDG micro positron emission tomography (microPET) imaging was performed 24 and 72 h after HI, as well as ex-vivo assessments of glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) oxidation. At adulthood behavioral tests and histology were performed. Behavioral and histological analysis showed greater impairments in HIP11 animals, while HIP3 rats were not affected. Changes in [(18)F]FDG metabolism were found only in the lesion area of HIP11, where a substantial hypometabolism was detected. Furthermore, [(18)F]FDG hypometabolism predicted impaired cognition and worst histological outcomes at adulthood. Finally, substrate oxidation assessments showed that glucose oxidation remained unaltered and higher level of BHB oxidation found in P3 animals, suggesting a more resilient metabolism. Overall, present results show [(18)F]FDG microPET predicts long-term injury outcome and suggests that higher BHB utilization is one of the mechanisms that confer the intrinsic neuroprotection to the immature brain and should be explored as a therapeutic target for treatment of HI.",0,Keto-Naive; Keto-Adapted,human,NS,"circulating total BHB, up",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"time to exhaustion, up","Endurance capacity, up","pre-workout supplement containing beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) salts, caffeine, and amino acids (KCA), approximately 7 g BHB",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

No studies to date have evaluated the impact of co-ingestion of ketone salts with caffeine and amino acids on high intensity exercise performance, and no data exists in Keto-Adapted individuals.Methods: We tested the performance and metabolic effects of a pre-workout supplement containing beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) salts, caffeine, and amino acids (KCA) in recreationally-active adults habitually consuming a mixed diet (Keto-Naive; n = 12) or a ketogenic diet (Keto-Adapted; n = 12). In a randomized and balanced manner, subjects consumed either the KCA consisting of approximately 7 g BHB (72% R-BHB and 28% S-BHB) with approximately 100 mg of caffeine, and amino acids (leucine and taurine) or Water (control condition) 15 minutes prior to performing a staged cycle ergometer time to exhaustion test followed immediately by a 30 second Wingate test.Results: Circulating total BHB concentrations increased rapidly after KCA ingestion in KN (154 to 732 muM) and KA (848 to 1,973 muM) subjects and stayed elevated throughout recovery in both groups. Plasma S-BHB increased >20-fold 15 minutes after KCA ingestion in both groups and remained elevated throughout recovery. Compared to Water, KCA ingestion increased time to exhaustion 8.3% in Keto-Naive and 9.8% in Keto-Adapted subjects (P < 0.001). There was no difference in power output during the Wingate test between trials. Peak lactate immediately after exercise was higher after KCA ( approximately 14.9 vs 12.7 mM).Conclusion: These results indicate that pre-exercise ingestion of a moderate dose of R- and S-BHB salts combined with caffeine, leucine and taurine improves high-intensity exercise performance to a similar extent in both Keto-Adapted and Keto-Naive individuals.",NLRP3,patients with T2D and high cardiovascular risk; macrophages (ex vivo),human; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"NLRP3 inflammasome activation, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,NS,NS,macrophages,Hematopoietic / Immune,Macrophages,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Activation of the NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and subsequent interleukin (IL)-1beta release induces atherosclerosis and heart failure. Here we show the effect of SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin on NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Patients with T2D and high cardiovascular risk receive SGLT2 inhibitor or sulfonylurea for 30 days, with NLRP3 inflammasome activation analyzed in macrophages. While the SGLT2 inhibitor's glucose-lowering capacity is similar to sulfonylurea, it shows a greater reduction in IL-1beta secretion compared to sulfonylurea accompanied by increased serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and decreased serum insulin. Ex vivo experiments with macrophages verify the inhibitory effects of high BHB and low insulin levels on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, SGLT2 inhibitor attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which might help to explain its cardioprotective effects.",0,individuals with obesity-related NAFLD; control participants; human skeletal muscle cell culture,human; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; In vitro – Primary cells,"mitochondrial respiration, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,skeletal muscle,Skeletal muscle,human skeletal muscle cells,Muscle – Skeletal,Skeletal myocytes / myotubes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"insulin sensitivity, up","Insulin sensitivity, up",fasting betaOHB; ketone dose (0.5-5.0 mM),Fasting / Caloric restriction (endogenous); In vitro media supplementation,NS

Reduced hepatic ketogenesis may promote these pathologies, but data are inconclusive in humans and the link between NAFLD and reduced insulin sensitivity remains obscure. We investigated individuals with obesity-related NAFLD and hypothesized that beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB; the predominant ketone species) would be reduced and related to hepatic fat accumulation and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, we hypothesized that ketones would impact skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration in vitro. Hepatic fat was assessed by (1)H-MRS in 22 participants in a parallel design, case control study [Control: n = 7, age 50 +/- 6 yr, body mass index (BMI) 30 +/- 1 kg/m(2); NAFLD: n = 15, age 57 +/- 3 yr, BMI 35 +/- 1 kg/m(2)]. Plasma assessments were conducted in the fasted state. Whole body insulin sensitivity was determined by the gold-standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The effect of ketone dose (0.5-5.0 mM) on mitochondrial respiration was conducted in human skeletal muscle cell culture. Fasting betaOHB, a surrogate measure of hepatic ketogenesis, was reduced in NAFLD (-15.6%, P < 0.01) and correlated negatively with liver fat (r(2) = 0.21, P = 0.03) and positively with insulin sensitivity (r(2) = 0.30, P = 0.01). Skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxygen consumption increased with low-dose ketones, attributable to increases in basal respiration (135%, P < 0.05) and ATP-linked oxygen consumption (136%, P < 0.05). NAFLD pathophysiology includes impaired hepatic ketogenesis, which is associated with hepatic fat accumulation and impaired insulin sensitivity. This reduced capacity to produce ketones may be a potential link between NAFLD and NAFLD-associated reductions in whole body insulin sensitivity, whereby ketone concentrations impact skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration.",0,isolated working mice hearts,animal,Animal – Mouse,"tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cardiac efficiency, down","Cardiac function, down",betaOHB,NS,NS
32407242,Ketones can become the major fuel source for the heart but do not increase cardiac efficiency.,"AIMS: Ketones have been proposed to be a 'thrifty' fuel for the heart and increasing cardiac ketone oxidation can be cardioprotective. However, it is unclear how much ketone oxidation can contribute to energy production in the heart, nor whether increasing ketone oxidation increases cardiac efficiency. Therefore, our goal was to determine to what extent high levels of the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), contributes to cardiac energy production, and whether this influences cardiac efficiency. METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated working mice hearts were aerobically perfused with palmitate (0.8 mM or 1.2 mM), glucose (5 mM) and increasing concentrations of betaOHB (0, 0.6, 2.0 mM). Subsequently, oxidation of these substrates, cardiac function, and cardiac efficiency were assessed. Increasing betaOHB concentrations increased myocardial ketone oxidation rates without affecting glucose or fatty acid oxidation rates where normal physiological levels of glucose (5 mM) and fatty acid (0.8 mM) are present. Notably, ketones became the major fuel source for the heart at 2.0 mM betaOHB (at both low or high fatty acid concentrations), with the elevated ketone oxidation rates markedly increasing tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, producing a large amount of reducing equivalents and finally, increasing myocardial oxygen consumption. However, the marked increase in ketone oxidation at high concentrations of betaOHB was not accompanied by an increase in cardiac work, suggesting that a mismatch between excess reduced equivalents production from ketone oxidation and cardiac adenosine triphosphate production. Consequently, cardiac efficiency decreased when the heart was exposed to higher ketone levels. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that while ketones can become the major fuel source for the heart, they do not increase cardiac efficiency, which also underscores the importance of recognizing ketones as a major fuel source for the heart in times of starvation, consumption of a ketogenic diet or poorly controlled diabetes.",0,12 highly trained male cyclists,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"glycolysis, down",Metabolic Regulation,muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"muscle glycogen sparing, no-change","Muscle glycogen, no-change",(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (KE),Ketone ester (KE),D-BHB

Therefore, we investigated whether acute exogenous ketosis by oral ketone ester (KE) intake early in a simulated cycling race can induce transient glycogen sparing by glycolytic inhibition, thereby increasing glycogen availability in the final phase of the event. In a randomized crossover design, 12 highly trained male cyclists completed a simulated cycling race (RACE), which consisted of 3-h intermittent cycling (IMT(180')), a 15-min time trial (TT(15')), and a maximal sprint (SPRINT). During RACE, subjects received 60 g carbohydrates/h combined with three boluses (25, 20, and 20 g) (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (KE) or a control drink (CON) at 60 and 20 min before and at 30 min during RACE. KE intake transiently increased blood d-beta-hydroxybutyrate to ~3 mM (range: 2.6-5.2 mM) during the first half of RACE (P < 0.001 vs. CON). Blood pH concomitantly decreased from approximately 7.42 to 7.36 (range: 7.29-7.40), whereas bicarbonate dropped from 26.0 to 21.6 mM (range: 20.1-23.7; both P < 0.001 vs. CON)(.) Net muscle glycogen breakdown during IMT(180') [KE: -78 +/- 30 (SD); CON: -60 +/- 22 mmol/kg wet wt; P = 0.08] and TT(15') (KE: -9 +/- 18; CON: -18 +/- 18 mmol/kg wet wt; P = 0.35) was similar between KE and CON. Accordingly, mean power output during TT(15') (KE: 273 +/- 38; CON: 272 +/- 37 W; P = 0.83) and time-to-exhaustion in the SPRINT (KE: 59 +/- 16; CON: 58 +/- 17 s; P = 0.66) were similar between conditions. In conclusion, KE intake during a simulated cycling race does not cause glycogen sparing, nor does it affect all-out performance in the final stage of a simulated race.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Exogenous ketosis produced by oral ketone ester ingestion during the early phase of prolonged endurance exercise and against the background of adequate carbohydrate intake neither causes muscle glycogen sparing nor improves performance in the final stage of the event. However, such exogenous ketosis may decrease buffering capacity in the approach of the final episode of the event.

Here, DBHB dynamics in the human colon were investigated using an in vitro colonic microbiota model, which maintained most of the operational taxonomic units detected in the original faeces. Over 54% of 0.41% (w/v) DBHB was metabolised by microbiota models originating from seven faecal samples after 30 h of fermentation (regarded as DBHB utilisers); however, <19% of DBHB was metabolised by microbiota models from five faecal samples (regarded as non-utilisers of DBHB). In utilisers, DBHB administration increased the relative abundance of the genus Coprococcus, correlated with increased butyrogenesis. Increased butyrogenesis was not observed in DBHB non-utilisers. Based on PICRUSt analysis, the relative abundance of beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase was maintained in microbiota models from DBHB utilisers following DBHB administration; however, it decreased in microbiota models from non-utilisers. After 21 h of fermentation, the intracellular glutamate concentration, which is indicative of growth, showed a positive correlation with DBHB utilisation (R(2) = 0.70).

Although beta-hydroxybutyrate plays various protective roles in the cardiovascular system, its ability to antagonize diabetic endothelial injury is unclear. beta-hydroxybutyrate reportedly causes histone H3K9 beta-hydroxybutyrylation (H3K9bhb), which activates gene expression; however, there has been no report regarding the role of H3K9bhb in up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a crucial factor in endothelial integrity and function. Here, male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin to induce diabetes, and then treated with different concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate. After 10 weeks, body weight, blood glucose, morphological changes and serum nitric oxide concentration were examined. Moreover, the mRNA expression level, protein content and distribution of VEGF in the aorta were investigated, as were total protein beta-hydroxybutyrylation and H3K9bhb contents. The results showed injury of aortic endothelium, along with reductions of the concentration of nitric oxide and generation of VEGF in diabetic rats. However, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment attenuated diabetic injury of the endothelium and up-regulated the generation of VEGF. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment caused marked total protein beta-hydroxybutyrylation and significant elevation of H3K9bhb content in the aorta of diabetic rats. The ability of beta-hydroxybutyrate to protect against diabetic injury of the aortic endothelium was greatest for its intermediate concentration. In conclusion, moderately elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate could antagonize aortic endothelial injury, potentially by causing H3K9bhb to promote generation of VEGF in diabetic rats.",NLRP3; 0,tamoxifen-inducible skeletal muscle-specific Oxct1 knockout mice; wild type littermate mice; isolated mouse hearts,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse,"NLRP3 inflammasome activation, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,heart,Heart,macrophage,Hematopoietic / Immune,Macrophages,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Heart failure,Cardiovascular,"ejection fraction, up; mitral E/A, up","Ejection fraction, up; Mitral E/A ratio, up",fasted circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate; addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate to isolated hearts,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
32508113,Chronically Elevating Circulating Ketones Can Reduce Cardiac Inflammation and Blunt the Development of Heart Failure.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of acute infusion of the primary ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate, in heart failure (HF). However, whether chronic elevations in circulating ketones are beneficial remains unknown. METHODS: To chronically elevate circulating ketones in mice, we deleted the expression of the ketolytic, rate-limiting-enzyme, SCOT (succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase 1; encoded by Oxct1), in skeletal muscle. Tamoxifen-inducible skeletal muscle-specific Oxct1(Muscle-)(/)(-) knockout (n=32) mice and littermate controls (wild type; WT; n=35) were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery to induce HF. RESULTS: Deletion of SCOT in skeletal, but not cardiac muscle resulted in elevated concentrations of fasted circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate in knockout mice compared with WT mice (P=0.030). Five weeks following TAC, WT mice progressed to HF, whereas knockout mice with elevated fasting circulating ketones were largely protected from the TAC-induced effects observed in WT mice (ejection fraction, P=0.011; mitral E/A, P=0.012). Furthermore, knockout mice with TAC had attenuated expression of markers of sterile inflammation and macrophage infiltration, which were otherwise elevated in WT mice subjected to TAC. Lastly, addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate to isolated hearts was associated with reduced NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein 3)-inflammasome activation, which has been previously shown to play a role in contributing to HF-induced cardiac inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that chronic elevation of circulating ketones protects against the development of HF that is associated with the ability of beta-hydroxybutyrate to directly reduce inflammation. These beneficial effects of ketones were associated with reduced cardiac NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suggesting that ketones may modulate cardiac inflammation via this mechanism.",IL10; CSF2,female S-SHR(11) rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"anti-inflammatory molecules, up",Inflammation & Immune Response,kidney,Kidney,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypertension; Chronic kidney disease,Cardiovascular; Renal & Urological,"systolic blood pressure, down; proteinuria, down; plasma creatinine, down; renal fibrosis, down","Blood pressure, down; Proteinuria, down; Serum creatinine, down; Fibrosis, down","1,3-butanediol (20% via drinking water)","1,3-Butanediol (BD)",NS

Hypertension (HTN) is the second leading risk factor for developing kidney disease. A recent study reported that increasing levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate levels by administration of its precursor, 1,3-butanediol, decreased salt-induced HTN in male Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rats. The effect of 1,3-butanediol on hypertensive kidney disease in female rats or the absence of high salt has not been investigated. This study tested the hypothesis that 1,3-butanediol attenuates HTN and the progression of CKD in female S-SHR(11) rats. The S-SHR(11) strain is a congenic rat strain generated from genetic modification of the Dahl S rat, previously characterized as a model of accelerated renal disease. Rats received 1,3-butanediol (20% via drinking water) or control for 10 wk and were maintained on a 0.3% NaCl rodent diet (n = 12-14 rats/group). Blood pressure was measured after 6 and 9 wk of treatment by tail-cuff plethysmography; after 10 wk, urine and tissues were collected. Activity of the treatment was confirmed by measuring plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, which were greater in the treated group. The 1,3-butanediol-treated group had lower systolic blood pressure, proteinuria, plasma creatinine, and renal fibrosis after 9 wk of treatment compared with controls. The treated group had significantly smaller spleens and increased the renal anti-inflammatory molecules interleukin-10 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, suggesting reduced inflammation.

Under these conditions, it can sustain ATP levels by its oxidation in mitochondria. As mitochondria can modify its shape and function under different nutritional challenges, we study the chronic effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation on mitochondrial morphology and function, and its relation to exercise capacity. Male C57BL/6 mice were supplemented with beta-hydroxybutyrate mineral salt (3.2%) or control (CT, NaCl/KCl) for six weeks and submitted to a weekly exercise performance test. We found an increase in distance, maximal speed, and time to exhaustion at two weeks of supplementation. Fatty acid metabolism and OXPHOS subunit proteins declined at two weeks in soleus but not in tibialis anterior muscles. Oxygen consumption rate on permeabilized fibers indicated a decrease in the presence of pyruvate in the short-term treatment. Both the tibialis anterior and soleus showed decreased levels of Mitofusin 2, while electron microscopy assessment revealed a significant reduction in mitochondrial cristae shape in the tibialis anterior, while a reduction in the mitochondrial number was observed only in soleus. These results suggest that short, but not long-term, beta‑hydroxybutyrate supplementation increases exercise capacity, associated with modifications in mitochondrial morphology and function in mouse skeletal muscle.",0,aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"SWD occurrence, down",Other / Unspecified,neural circuit,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"SWD occurrence (in sleep), down","Seizure activity, down",1 g/kg intraperitoneal injection,Intraperitoneal BHB,NS

To shed light on their possible treatment options, we assessed the effect of drugs with variable and known mechanisms of action on the occurrence of SWDs in aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. The treatments included prototypic antiepileptic drugs (ethosuximide and levetiracetam), donepezil as the typical Alzheimer drug and atropine as an antagonistic effect, GABA(B) antagonist CGP-35348, and alternate energy substrates beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), pyruvate and lactate on the occurrence of SWDs in aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. All agents were administered by single intraperitoneal injections at doses earlier documented to be effective and response was assessed by recording 3 h of video-EEG. Atropine at 25 mg/kg significantly decreased SWD occurrence in all behavioral states, and also resulted in altered frequency composition of SWDs and general EEG slowing during sleep. Ethosuximide at 200 mg/kg and levetiracetam at 75 mg/kg effectively suppressed SWDs only during a period of mixed behavioral states, but levetiracetam also increased SWDs in sleep. BHB at 1 g/kg decreased SWDs in sleep, while both pyruvate and lactate at the same dose tended to increase SWD number and total duration. Unexpectantly, donepezil at 0.3 mg/kg CGP-35348 at 100 mg/kg had no effect on SWDs. These findings call for re-evaluation of some prevailing theories on neural circuit alternations that underlie SWD generation and show the utility of APP/PS1 mice for testing potential new treatments for nonconvulsive epileptic activity related to Alzheimer pathology.",0,Prox1(DeltaOXCT1) mice; mouse model of microsurgical ablation of LVs in the tail; corneal injury; myocardial infarction; LECs in vitro,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; NS; In vitro – Primary cells,"acetyl-CoA levels up, nan; tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolite pools up, nan; nucleotide precursor and deoxynucleotide triphosphate levels up, nan",Metabolic Regulation; Multiple mechanisms,lymphatic vessels,Vasculature,lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs),Endothelial,Lymphatic endothelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Corneal injury; Myocardial infarction; nan,Injury & Trauma; Cardiovascular; Other / Unspecified,"lymphangiogenesis up, nan; LV function and growth up, nan; infiltration of anti-lymphangiogenic immune cells down, nan; oedema down, nan","Lymphangiogenesis, nan; Cardiac function, nan; Inflammation, nan; Pulmonary edema, nan","high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet; administration of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate",Ketogenic diet (endogenous); Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

However, the role of metabolism in LECs has been incompletely elucidated. In the present study, it is reported that LEC-specific loss of OXCT1, a key enzyme of ketone body oxidation(2), reduces LEC proliferation, migration and vessel sprouting in vitro and impairs lymphangiogenesis in development and disease in Prox1(DeltaOXCT1) mice. Mechanistically, OXCT1 silencing lowers acetyl-CoA levels, tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolite pools, and nucleotide precursor and deoxynucleotide triphosphate levels required for LEC proliferation. Ketone body supplementation to LECs induces the opposite effects. Notably, elevation of lymph ketone body levels by a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet or by administration of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate increases lymphangiogenesis after corneal injury and myocardial infarction. Intriguingly, in a mouse model of microsurgical ablation of LVs in the tail, which repeats features of acquired lymphoedema in humans, the ketogenic diet improves LV function and growth, reduces infiltration of anti-lymphangiogenic immune cells and decreases oedema, suggesting a novel dietary therapeutic opportunity.",0,rats; human vastus lateralis,animal; in vitro; human,Animal – Rat; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"product inhibition, down",Metabolic Regulation,skeletal muscle,Skeletal muscle,muscle fiber,Muscle – Skeletal,Skeletal myocytes / myotubes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"mitochondrial respiration, down","Mitochondrial respiration, down",sodium dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic
32765945,In vitro ketone-supported mitochondrial respiration is minimal when other substrates are readily available in cardiac and skeletal muscle.,"KEY POINTS: Ketone bodies are proposed to represent an alternative fuel source driving energy production, particularly during exercise. Biologically, the extent to which mitochondria utilize ketone bodies compared to other substrates remains unknown. We demonstrate in vitro that maximal mitochondrial respiration supported by ketone bodies is low when compared to carbohydrate-derived substrates in the left ventricle and red gastrocnemius muscle from rodents, and in human skeletal muscle. When considering intramuscular concentrations of ketone bodies and the presence of other carbohydrate and lipid substrates, biological rates of mitochondrial respiration supported by ketone bodies are predicted to be minimal. At the mitochondrial level, it is therefore unlikely that ketone bodies are an important source for energy production in cardiac and skeletal muscle, particularly when other substrates are readily available. ABSTRACT: Ketone bodies (KB) have recently gained popularity as an alternative fuel source to support mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and enhance exercise performance. However, given the low activity of ketolytic enzymes and potential inhibition from carbohydrate oxidation, it remains unknown if KBs can contribute to energy production. We therefore determined the ability of KBs (sodium dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate, beta-HB; lithium acetoacetate, AcAc) to stimulate in vitro mitochondrial respiration in the left ventricle (LV) and red gastrocnemius (RG) of rats, and in human vastus lateralis. Compared to pyruvate, the ability of KBs to maximally drive respiration was low in isolated mitochondria and permeabilized fibres (PmFb) from the LV ( approximately 30-35% of pyruvate), RG ( approximately 10-30%), and human vastus lateralis ( approximately 2-10%). In PmFb, the concentration of KBs required to half-maximally drive respiration (LV: 889 microm beta-HB, 801 microm AcAc; RG: 782 microm beta-HB, 267 microm AcAc) were greater than KB content representative of the muscle microenvironment ( approximately 100 microm). This would predict low rates ( approximately 1-4% of pyruvate) of biological KB-supported respiration in the LV (8-14 pmol s(-1) mg(-1) ) and RG (3-6 pmol s(-1) mg(-1) ) at rest and following exercise. Moreover, KBs did not increase respiration in the presence of saturating pyruvate, submaximal pyruvate (100 microm) reduced the ability of physiological beta-HB to drive respiration, and addition of other intracellular substrates (succinate + palmitoylcarnitine) decreased maximal KB-supported respiration. As a result, product inhibition is likely to limit KB oxidation. Altogether, the ability of KBs to drive mitochondrial respiration is minimal and they are likely to be outcompeted by other substrates, compromising their use as an important energy source.",HCAR2; 0; PRKAA1,aged rats; HepG2 cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"GPR109A/AMPK pathway activation, up",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,HepG2 cells,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,endoplasmic reticulum,Endoplasmic Reticulum,Unspecified,Hepatic steatosis,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"hepatic steatosis, down","Liver steatosis, down",NS,NS,NS
32772200,beta-Hydroxybutyrate Suppresses Lipid Accumulation in Aged Liver through GPR109A-mediated Signaling.,"Dietary interventions such as prolonged calorie restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting provide health benefits including a reduction in the inflammatory burden and regulation of energy metabolism. During CR, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) level is elevated in the serum. BHB is a ligand of GPR109A, which inhibits lipolysis and exerts anti-inflammatory effects on cells. During aging, comorbidities related to dyslipidemia are significantly associated with fatty liver. However, the underlying mechanisms of BHB in hepatic ER stress and dyslipidemia are unclear and remain to be elucidated. Here, we used aged rats that were administered with BHB and compared the modulatory effects of BHB through the GPR109A/AMPK pathway on the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and lipid accumulation to CR rats. BHB caused suppression of hepatic ER stress and lipid accumulation through GPR109A/AMPK pathway in the aged rats. Aged rats of both treatment groups showed reduced cAMP level and PKA phosphorylation. Furthermore, AMPK-Ser173 phosphorylation via PKA was decreased, whereas AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation was increased by BHB and CR. Further supporting evidence was provided in HepG2 cells that BHB inhibited ER stress and lipid accumulation induced by palmitate. These results suggest that BHB activates GPR109A and regulates the activation of AMPK. These findings were further confirmed by GPR109A-siRNA transfection in vitro. In addition, BHB treatment elevated the protein levels of AMPK leading to significant inhibition of hepatic steatosis, whereas AMPK-siRNA treatment abolished these effects. Taken together, these findings suggest that BHB could be a effective molecule that mimics CR in ameliorating age-related hepatic lipid accumulation via GPR109A signaling pathway.",0; MMP2; SMAD3,Male Sprague-Dawley rats; streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"H3K9bhb in Mmp-2 promoter, up",Multiple mechanisms,kidney,Kidney,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetic glomerulosclerosis,Renal & Urological,"glomerular morphological changes, attenuated","Kidney function, attenuated",different concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

The aim of this study was to investigate the antagonizing effects of BHB against diabetic glomerulosclerosis and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin to induce diabetes and then treated with different concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate. After 10 weeks, body weight, blood glucose, serum creatinine and 24-h urine protein were examined. Glomerular morphological changes and the contents of collagen type IV (COL IV) were evaluated. Then, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/Smad3 contents and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) generation were detected. Moreover, the total contents of trans-activating histone H3K9 beta-hydroxybutyrylation (H3K9bhb) and the contents of H3K9bhb in the Mmp-2 promoter were measured. RESULTS: It was firstly confirmed that BHB treatments reduced renal biochemical indicators and attenuated glomerular morphological changes of the diabetic rats, with COL IV content decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. Then, BHB treatments were found to up-regulate renal MMP-2 generation of the diabetic rats significantly, while not affecting the increased TGF-beta/Smad3 contents. Furthermore, the contents of H3K9bhb in the Mmp-2 promoter were elevated significantly for the middle and high concentrations of BHB treatments, up-regulating MMP-2 generation. CONCLUSION: BHB treatments could up-regulate MMP-2 generation via causing elevated H3K9bhb in its promoter to antagonize glomerulosclerosis in the diabetic rats.",0,Sprague-Dawley (SPD) rats; WAG/Rij (WR) rats; GLUT-1 Deficiency Syndrome (G1D) mice,animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Mouse,"R-beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, up",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,GLUT1 deficiency syndrome,Genetic / Congenital,"motor performance, up","Motor function, up",ketogenic diet (KD); butanediol (BD); ketone-ester (KE); ketone-salt (KS); KE + KS (KEKS); KE + MCT (KEMCT); KS + MCT (KSMCT),"Ketogenic diet (endogenous); 1,3-Butanediol (BD); Ketone ester (KE); Ketone salt (KS); Multi-source",D-BHB

While inducing nutritional ketosis, ketogenic diet (KD) can improve motor performance in the context of certain disease states, but it is unknown whether exogenous ketone supplements-alternatives to KDs-may have similar effects. Therefore, we investigated the effect of ketone supplements on motor performance, using accelerating rotarod test and on postexercise blood glucose and R-beta-hydroxybutyrate (R-betaHB) levels in rodent models with and without pathology. The effect of KD, butanediol (BD), ketone-ester (KE), ketone-salt (KS), and their combination (KE + KS: KEKS) or mixtures with medium chain triglyceride (MCT) (KE + MCT: KEMCT; KS + MCT: KSMCT) was tested in Sprague-Dawley (SPD) and WAG/Rij (WR) rats and in GLUT-1 Deficiency Syndrome (G1D) mice. Motor performance was enhanced by KEMCT acutely, KE and KS subchronically in SPD rats, by KEKS and KEMCT groups in WR rats, and by KE chronically in G1D mice. We demonstrated that exogenous ketone supplementation improved motor performance to various degrees in rodent models, while effectively elevated R-betaHB and in some cases offsets postexercise blood glucose elevations.

32868580,beta-Hydroxybutyrate Oxidation Promotes the Accumulation of Immunometabolites in Activated Microglia Cells.,"Metabolic regulation of immune cells has arisen as a critical set of processes required for appropriate response to immunological signals. While our knowledge in this area has rapidly expanded in leukocytes, much less is known about the metabolic regulation of brain-resident microglia. In particular, the role of alternative nutrients to glucose remains poorly understood. Here, we use stable-isotope ((13)C) tracing strategies and metabolomics to characterize the oxidative metabolism of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in human (HMC3) and murine (BV2) microglia cells and the interplay with glucose in resting and LPS-activated BV2 cells. We found that BHB is imported and oxidised in the TCA cycle in both cell lines with a subsequent increase in the cytosolic NADH:NAD(+) ratio. In BV2 cells, stimulation with LPS upregulated the glycolytic flux, increased the cytosolic NADH:NAD(+) ratio and promoted the accumulation of the glycolytic intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). The addition of BHB enhanced LPS-induced accumulation of DHAP and promoted glucose-derived lactate export. BHB also synergistically increased LPS-induced accumulation of succinate and other key immunometabolites, such as alpha-ketoglutarate and fumarate generated by the TCA cycle. Finally, BHB upregulated the expression of a key pro-inflammatory (M1 polarisation) marker gene, NOS2, in BV2 cells activated with LPS. In conclusion, we identify BHB as a potentially immunomodulatory metabolic substrate for microglia that promotes metabolic reprogramming during pro-inflammatory response.",0,six athletes,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"exogenous betaHB oxidation, no-change",Metabolic Regulation,skeletal muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) ketone monoester (KME) (low-dose 252 mg.kg BW-1; high-dose 752 mg.kg BW-1),Multi-source; NS,NS
32872407,The Effect of Blood Ketone Concentration and Exercise Intensity on Exogenous Ketone Oxidation Rates in Athletes.,"INTRODUCTION: Exogenous ketones potentially provide an alternative, energetically advantageous fuel to power exercising skeletal muscle. However, there is limited evidence regarding their relative contribution to energy expenditure during exercise. Furthermore, the effect of blood ketone concentration and exercise intensity on exogenous ketone oxidation rates is unknown. METHODS: Six athletes completed cycling ergometer exercise on three occasions within a single-blind, random-order controlled, crossover design study. Exercise duration was 60 min, consisting of 20-min intervals at 25%, 50%, and 75% maximal power output (WMax). Participants consumed (i) bitter flavored water (control), (ii) a low-dose beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) ketone monoester (KME; 252 mg.kg BW-1, ""low ketosis""), or (iii) a high-dose betaHB KME (752 mg.kg BW-1, ""high ketosis""). The KME contained a 13C isotope label, allowing for the determination of whole-body exogenous betaHB oxidation rates through sampled respiratory gases. RESULTS: Despite an approximate doubling of blood betaHB concentrations between low- and high-ketosis conditions (~2 mM vs ~4.4 mM), exogenous betaHB oxidation rates were similar at rest and throughout exercise. The contribution of exogenous betaHB oxidation to energy expenditure peaked during the 25% WMax exercise intensity but was relatively low (4.46% +/- 2.71%). Delta efficiency during cycling exercise was significantly greater in the low-ketosis (25.9% +/- 2.1%) versus control condition (24.1% +/- 1.9%; P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of exercise intensity, exogenous betaHB oxidation contributes minimally to energy expenditure and is not increased by elevating circulating concentrations greater than ~2 mM. Despite low exogenous betaHB oxidation rates, exercise efficiency was significantly improved when blood betaHB concentration was raised to ~2 mM.",0,cultured adipocytes; rodent subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT); human subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT),human; animal; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"mitochondrial coupling, altered",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT),Adipose tissue,adipocytes,Adipose,White adipocytes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
32941737,Ketones Elicit Distinct Alterations in Adipose Mitochondrial Bioenergetics.,"OBJECTIVE: The rampant growth of obesity worldwide has stimulated explosive research into human metabolism. Energy expenditure has been shown to be altered by diets differing in macronutrient composition, with low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diets eliciting a significant increase over other interventions. The central aim of this study was to explore the effects of the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) on mitochondrial bioenergetics in adipose tissue. METHODS: We employed three distinct systems-namely, cell, rodent, and human models. Following exposure to elevated betaHB, we obtained adipose tissue to quantify mitochondrial function. RESULTS: In every model, betaHB robustly increased mitochondrial respiration, including an increase of roughly 91% in cultured adipocytes, 113% in rodent subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and 128% in human SAT. However, this occurred without a commensurate increase in adipose ATP production. Furthermore, in cultured adipocytes and rodent adipose, we quantified and observed an increase in the gene expression involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and uncoupling status following betaHB exposure. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, betaHB increases mitochondrial respiration, but not ATP production, in mammalian adipocytes, indicating altered mitochondrial coupling. These findings may partly explain the increased metabolic rate evident in states of elevated ketones, and may facilitate the development of novel anti-obesity interventions.",0,"healthy young volunteers (10 males/9 females; age, 24.7 +/- 4.9 years; body mass index, 22.7 +/- 2.4 kg/m(2))",human,Multi-model; Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"insulin release, no-change; gastric emptying, no-change",Hormonal Regulation; Other / Unspecified,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"postprandial glucose AUC, down; NEFA AUC, down","Blood glucose, down; Free fatty acids, down",ketone monoester (KME) supplement,Ketone ester (KE),NS

Nineteen healthy young volunteers (10 males/9 females; age, 24.7 +/- 4.9 years; body mass index, 22.7 +/- 2.4 kg/m(2)) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Following overnight fasting (>/=10 h), participants consumed 0.45 mL/kg of a KME supplement or taste-matched placebo followed by an MMTT 15 min later. Blood samples were collected every 15-30 min over 2.5 h. KME supplementation acutely raised beta-hydroxybutyrate AUC (590%, P < 0.0001, d = 2.4) and resulted in decreases in blood glucose AUC (-9.4%, P = 0.03, d = 0.56) and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) AUC (-27.3%, P = 0.023, d = 0.68) compared with placebo. No differences were found for plasma insulin AUC (P = 0.70) or gastric emptying estimated by co-ingested acetaminophen AUC (P = 0.96) between ketone and placebo. Overall, results indicate that KME supplementation attenuates postprandial glycemic and NEFA responses when taken 15 min prior to a mixed meal in young healthy individuals. Future studies are warranted to investigate whether KME supplementation may benefit individuals with impaired glycemic control. Novelty: Acute ketone monoester supplementation 15 min prior to a mixed meal decreased postprandial glucose and NEFA levels without significantly impacting postprandial insulin or estimates of gastric emptying. Glucose- and NEFA-lowering effects of ketone monoester supplementation are apparently not mediated by changes in insulin release or gastric emptying.",NLRP3; PYCARD; CASP1,5XFAD mouse; AD patients,human; animal,Animal – Mouse; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NLRP3 inflammasome activation, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,brain parenchyma,Brain/CNS,microglia,Neural / Glial,Microglia,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"AD pathology, down","Neuroinflammation, down",exogenous BHB administration,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Recent studies suggest that AD pathology is driven by age-related changes in metabolism. Alterations in metabolism, such as placing patients on a ketogenic diet, can alter cognition by an unknown mechanism. One of the ketone bodies produced as a result of ketogenesis, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), is known to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Therefore, we tested if BHB inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome reduces overall AD pathology in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. Here, we find BHB levels are lower in red blood cells and brain parenchyma of AD patients when compared with non-AD controls. Furthermore, exogenous BHB administration reduced plaque formation, microgliosis, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (Asc) speck formation, and caspase-1 activation in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that BHB reduces AD pathology by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

We aimed to characterize skeletal muscle mitochondrial changes in response to a ketogenic diet combined with exercise training in healthy individuals. Twenty-nine physically active adults completed a 12-wk supervised exercise program after self-selection into a ketogenic diet (KD, n = 15) group or maintenance of their habitual mixed diet (MD, n = 14). Measures of metabolic health and muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) were obtained before and after the intervention. Mitochondria were isolated from muscle and studied after exposure to carbohydrate (pyruvate), fat (palmitoyl-l-carnitine), and ketone (beta-hydroxybutyrate+acetoacetate) substrates. Compared with MD, the KD resulted in increased whole body resting fat oxidation (P < 0.001) and decreased fasting insulin (P = 0.019), insulin resistance [homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), P = 0.022], and visceral fat (P < 0.001). The KD altered mitochondrial function as evidenced by increases in mitochondrial respiratory control ratio (19%, P = 0.009), ATP production (36%, P = 0.028), and ATP/H(2)O(2) (36%, P = 0.033) with the fat-based substrate. ATP production with the ketone-based substrate was four to eight times lower than with other substrates, indicating minimal oxidation. The KD resulted in a small decrease in muscle glycogen (14%, P = 0.035) and an increase in muscle triglyceride (81%, P = 0.006). These results expand our understanding of human adaptation to a ketogenic diet combined with exercise.

The first two sessions consisted of a 5-km running time trial familiarization and a VO(2max) test. During subsequent trials, subjects were randomly assigned to one (KS1: 22.1 g) or two (KS2: 44.2 g) doses of beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) and medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) or flavor matched placebo (PLA). Blood R-betaHB, glucose, and lactate concentrations were measured at baseline (0-min), post-supplement (30 and 60 min), post-exercise (+ 0 min, + 15 min). Time, heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), affect, respiratory exchange ratio, oxygen consumption (VO(2)), carbon dioxide production, and ventilation were measured during exercise. Cognitive performance was evaluated prior to and post-exercise. RESULTS: KS significantly increased R-betaHB, with more potent and prolonged elevations in KS2, illustrating an administrative and dosing effect. R-betaHB was significantly decreased in KS1 compared to KS2 illustrating a dosing and exercise interaction effect. Blood glucose elevated post-exercise but was unchanged across groups. Blood lactate significantly increased post-exercise but was augmented by KS administration. Gaseous exchange, respiration, HR, affect, RPE, and exercise performance was unaltered with KS administration. However, clear responders and none-responders were indicated. KS2 significantly augmented cognitive function in pre-exercise conditions, while exercise increased cognitive performance for KS1 and PLA to pre-exercise KS2 levels.

We investigated the acute effects of ketone monoester (KM) ingestion on blood glucose levels during the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in participants with impaired glucose tolerance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine Japanese adults aged 48-62 years (4 men, 5 women) with impaired glucose tolerance participated in this study. After participants fasted overnight, we carried out OGTT for 180 min with and without KM ingestion on two separate days in a randomized cross-over design. We compared the area under the curve (AUC) of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon and free fatty acids during OGTT. RESULTS: The AUC of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate during OGTT was significantly higher with KM than without KM (KM 5995.3 +/- 1257.1 mmol/L.h; without KM 116.1 +/- 33.9 mmol/L.h, P < 0.0001), and the AUC of glucose with KM was significantly lower than that without KM (KM 406.6 +/- 70.6 mg/dL.h; without KM 483.2 +/- 74.3 mg/dL.h, P < 0.0001). This improved glucose excursion was associated with enhanced AUC of insulin during the first half (0-90 min) of OGTT, even though the AUC of C-peptide during this period was unchanged. In contrast, the AUC of insulin, C-peptide, glucagon and free fatty acids during 180 min of OGTT were similar in both conditions. CONCLUSION: The ingestion of KM decreased the AUC of glucose during 75-g OGTT in Japanese individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, and the mechanism might involve elevated levels of circulating early phase insulin.",KCNQ3; 0,BFNE family; Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells,human; in vitro,NS; Multi-model,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells,Unspecified / Mixed,Cell line (origin unclear),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"channel dysfunction, down","Neuronal survival, down",a ketone body generated during the ketogenic diet (KD),Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
33013465,A Novel Kv7.3 Variant in the Voltage-Sensing S(4) Segment in a Family With Benign Neonatal Epilepsy: Functional Characterization and in vitro Rescue by beta-Hydroxybutyrate.,"Pathogenic variants in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, paralogous genes encoding Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 voltage-gated K(+) channel subunits, are responsible for early-onset developmental/epileptic disorders characterized by heterogeneous clinical phenotypes ranging from benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE) to early-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). KCNQ2 variants account for the majority of pedigrees with BFNE and KCNQ3 variants are responsible for a much smaller subgroup, but the reasons for this imbalance remain unclear. Analysis of additional pedigrees is needed to further clarify the nature of this genetic heterogeneity and to improve prediction of pathogenicity for novel variants. We identified a BFNE family with two siblings and a parent affected. Exome sequencing on samples from both parents and siblings revealed a novel KCNQ3 variant (c.719T>G; p.M240R), segregating in the three affected individuals. The M240 residue is conserved among human Kv7.2-5 and lies between the two arginines (R5 and R6) closest to the intracellular side of the voltage-sensing S(4) transmembrane segment. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells revealed that homomeric Kv7.3 M240R channels were not functional, whereas heteromeric channels incorporating Kv7.3 M240R mutant subunits with Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 displayed a depolarizing shift of about 10 mV in activation gating. Molecular modeling results suggested that the M240R substitution preferentially stabilized the resting state and possibly destabilized the activated state of the Kv7.3 subunits, a result consistent with functional data. Exposure to beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body generated during the ketogenic diet (KD), reversed channel dysfunction induced by the M240R variant. In conclusion, we describe the first missense loss-of-function (LoF) pathogenic variant within the S(4) segment of Kv7.3 identified in patients with BFNE. Studied under conditions mimicking heterozygosity, the M240R variant mainly affects the voltage sensitivity, in contrast to previously analyzed BFNE Kv7.3 variants that reduce current density. Our pharmacological results provide a rationale for the use of KD in patients carrying LoF variants in Kv7.2 or Kv7.3 subunits.",BDNF,normal-weight adults; adults with obesity,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"beta-OHB elevation, up",Metabolic Regulation,plasma,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hyperglycemia,Metabolic & Endocrine,"hyperglycemia, down","Blood glucose, down",ketone monoester (KME) drink,Ketone ester (KE),NS
33053357,The Effect of Exogenous Ketone Monoester Ingestion on Plasma BDNF During an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test.,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is important for brain and metabolic function. Ingestion of a ketone monoester (KME) drink containing beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) attenuates hyperglycemia in humans and increases neuronal BDNF in rodents. Whether KME affects BDNF in humans is currently unknown. This study examined the effect of KME ingestion before an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on plasma BDNF in normal-weight adults (NW) and adults with obesity (OB). Methods: Exploratory, secondary analyses of two studies were performed. Study 1 included NW (n = 18; age = 25.3 +/- 4.3 years; BMI = 22.2 +/- 2.3 kg/m(2)) and Study 2 included OB (n = 12; age = 48.8 +/- 9.5 years; BMI = 33.7 +/- 5.0 kg/m(2)). Participants ingested 0.45 ml/kg(-1) body weight KME or Placebo 30-min prior to completing a 75 g OGTT. beta-OHB and BDNF were measured via blood samples at fasting baseline (pre-OGTT) and 120 min post-OGTT. Results: Study 1: KME significantly increased beta-OHB by 800 +/- 454% (p < 0.001). BDNF significantly decreased post-OGTT compared to pre-OGTT in Placebo (718.6 +/- 830.8 pg/ml vs. 389.3 +/- 595.8 pg/ml; p = 0.018), whereas BDNF was unchanged in KME (560.2 +/- 689.6 pg/ml vs. 469.2 +/- 791.8 pg/ml; p = 0.28). Study 2: KME significantly increased beta-OHB by 1,586 +/- 602% (p < 0.001). BDNF was significantly higher post-OGTT in the KME condition in OB (time x condition interaction; p = 0.037). There was a moderate relationship between beta-OHB and ∆ %BDNF (r = 0.616; p < 0.001). Fasting plasma BDNF was significantly lower in OB compared to NW (132.8 +/- 142.8 pg/ml vs. 639.4 +/- 756.8 pg/ml; g = 0.845; p = 0.002). Conclusions: Plasma BDNF appears differentially impacted by KME ingestion with OGTT in OB compared to NW.

The gut microbiota has been recently shown to regulate brain functions and behavior but convincing evidence of its role in AUD is lacking. Here, we show that gut dysbiosis is associated with metabolic alterations that affect behavioral (depression, sociability) and neurobiological (myelination, neurotransmission, inflammation) processes involved in alcohol addiction. By transplanting the gut microbiota from AUD patients to mice, we point out that the production of ethanol by specific bacterial genera and the reduction of lipolysis are associated with a lower hepatic synthesis of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which thereby prevents the neuroprotective effect of BHB. We confirm these results in detoxified AUD patients, in which we observe a persisting ethanol production in the feces as well as correlations among low plasma BHB levels and social impairments, depression, or brain white matter alterations.",MTOR,wild-type mice; transverse aortic constriction; cardiomyocytes,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells,"mTOR signalling suppression, down",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,cardiomyocytes,Muscle – Cardiac,Cardiomyocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Cardiac hypertrophy,Cardiovascular,"phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy, down","Hypertrophy, down",Fat-LC diet; ketone body supplementation,Ketogenic diet (endogenous); NS,NS
33087477,Dietary carbohydrates restriction inhibits the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.,"AIMS: A diet with modified components, such as a ketogenic low-carbohydrate (LC) diet, potentially extends longevity and healthspan. However, how an LC diet impacts on cardiac pathology during haemodynamic stress remains elusive. This study evaluated the effects of an LC diet high in either fat (Fat-LC) or protein (Pro-LC) in a mouse model of chronic hypertensive cardiac remodelling. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wild-type mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction, followed by feeding with the Fat-LC, the Pro-LC, or a high-carbohydrate control diet. After 4 weeks, echocardiographic, haemodynamic, histological, and biochemical analyses were performed. LC diet consumption after pressure overload inhibited the development of pathological hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction compared to the control diet. An anti-hypertrophic serine/threonine kinase, GSK-3beta, was re-activated by both LC diets; however, the Fat-LC, but not the Pro-LC, diet exerted cardioprotection in GSK-3beta cardiac-specific knockout mice. beta-hydroxybutyrate, a major ketone body in mammals, was increased in the hearts of mice fed the Fat-LC, but not the Pro-LC, diet. In cardiomyocytes, ketone body supplementation inhibited phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy, in part by suppressing mTOR signalling. CONCLUSION: Strict carbohydrate restriction suppresses pathological cardiac growth and heart failure after pressure overload through distinct anti-hypertrophic mechanisms elicited by supplemented macronutrients.",SLC18A2; MBP; MAG,aralar-knock-out (KO) neurons; aralar-KO mice,animal; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells; Animal – Mouse,"mitochondrial betaOHB oxidation, up",Metabolic Regulation,cortex,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,AGC1 deficiency,Genetic / Congenital,"myelination, up","Myelination, up",intraperitoneal injections of betaOHB,Intraperitoneal BHB,NS
33100965,betaOHB Protective Pathways in Aralar-KO Neurons and Brain: An Alternative to Ketogenic Diet.,"Aralar/AGC1/Slc25a12, the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier expressed in neurons, is the regulatory component of the NADH malate-aspartate shuttle. AGC1 deficiency is a neuropediatric rare disease characterized by hypomyelination, hypotonia, developmental arrest, and epilepsy. We have investigated whether beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), the main ketone body (KB) produced in ketogenic diet (KD), is neuroprotective in aralar-knock-out (KO) neurons and mice. We report that betaOHB efficiently recovers aralar-KO neurons from deficits in basal-stimulated and glutamate-stimulated respiration, effects requiring betaOHB entry into the neuron, and protects from glutamate excitotoxicity. Aralar-deficient mice were fed a KD to investigate its therapeutic potential early in development, but this approach was unfeasible. Therefore, aralar-KO pups were treated without distinction of gender with daily intraperitoneal injections of betaOHB during 5 d. This treatment resulted in a recovery of striatal markers of the dopaminergic system including dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)/DA ratio, and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) protein. Regarding postnatal myelination, myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) myelin proteins were markedly increased in the cortices of betaOHB-treated aralar-KO mice. Although brain Asp and NAA levels did not change by betaOHB administration, a 4-d betaOHB treatment to aralar-KO, but not to control, neurons led to a substantial increase in Asp (3-fold) and NAA (4-fold) levels. These results suggest that the lack of increase in brain Asp and NAA is possibly because of its active utilization by the aralar-KO brain and the likely involvement of neuronal NAA in postnatal myelination in these mice. The effectiveness of betaOHB as a therapeutic treatment in AGC1 deficiency deserves further investigation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAralar deficiency induces a fatal phenotype in humans and mice and is associated with impaired neurodevelopment, epilepsy, and hypomyelination. In neurons, highly expressing aralar, its deficiency causes a metabolic blockade hampering mitochondrial energetics and respiration. Here, we find that betaOHB, the main metabolic product in KD, recovers defective mitochondrial respiration bypassing the metabolic failure in aralar-deficient neurons. betaOHB oxidation in mitochondria boosts the synthesis of cytosolic aspartate (Asp) and NAA, which is impeded by aralar deficiency, presumably through citrate-malate shuttle. In aralar-knock-out (KO) mice, betaOHB recovers from the drastic drop in specific dopaminergic and myelin markers. The betaOHB-induced myelin synthesis occurring together with the marked increment in neuronal NAA synthesis supports the role of NAA as a lipid precursor during postnatal myelination.",0,"Parkinson's disease patients (n=14, age 40-80, Hoehn and Yahr stage 1-2)",human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"respiratory exchange ratio, down",Metabolic Regulation,serum,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Parkinson's disease,Neurodegenerative,"endurance exercise performance (time sustaining 80 rpm cadence), up","Endurance capacity, up",ketone ester drink,Ketone ester (KE),NS
33101467,A Ketone Ester Drink Enhances Endurance Exercise Performance in Parkinson's Disease.,"OBJECTIVES: Routine exercise is thought to be among the only disease-modifying treatments for Parkinson's disease; however, patients' progressive loss of physical ability limits its application. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether a ketone ester drink, which has previously been shown to enhance endurance exercise performance in elite athletes, could also improve performance in persons with Parkinson's disease. PARTICIPANTS: 14 patients, aged 40-80 years, with Hoehn and Yahr stage 1-2 Parkinson's disease. INTERVENTION: A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study in which each participant was administered a ketone ester drink or an isocaloric carbohydrate-based control drink on separate occasions prior to engaging in a steady state cycling test at 80 rpm to assess endurance exercise performance. OUTCOMES MEASURES: The primary outcome variable was length of time participants could sustain a therapeutic 80 rpm cadence. Secondary, metabolic outcomes measures included cardiorespiratory parameters as well as serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, and lactate. RESULTS: The ketone ester increased the time that participants were able to sustain an 80 rpm cycling cadence by 24 +/- 9% (p = 0.027). Correspondingly, the ketone ester increased beta-hydroxybutyrate levels to >3 mmol/L and decreased respiratory exchange ratio, consistent with a shift away from carbohydrate-dependent metabolism. CONCLUSION: Ketone ester supplementation improved endurance exercise performance in persons with Parkinson's disease and may, therefore, be useful as an adjunctive therapy to enhance the effectiveness of exercise treatment for Parkinson's disease.",ENO2; GFAP,kainic acid (KA)-induced rat seizure model,animal,Animal – Rat,"inflammatory responses, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"neuronal damage, down","Neuronal survival, down",administrated intraperitoneally at a dose of 4 mmol/kg 30 min prior to KA injection,Intraperitoneal BHB,NS

The KA-induced rat seizure model was established and BHB was administrated intraperitoneally at a dose of 4 mmol/kg 30 min prior to KA injection. Hippocampal tissues were then obtained 1, 3 and 7 days following KA administration, following which the expression levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured using a double immunofluorescence labeling method. In addition, the contents of glutathione (GSH), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and ATP were measured using ELISA. Pretreatment with BHB markedly increased the expression of NSE after KA injection compared with that in the normal saline (NS) + KA group, suggesting that the application of BHB could alleviate neuronal damage in rats. The protective effect of BHB may be associated with suppressed inflammatory responses, which was indicated by the observed inhibition of GFAP expression in rats in the BHB + KA group compared with that in the NS + KA group. It was also found that GSH and GABA contents were notably increased after the rats were pretreated with BHB compared with those in the NS + KA group.

33108630,beta-Hydroxybutyrate inhibits histone deacetylase 3 to promote claudin-5 generation and attenuate cardiac microvascular hyperpermeability in diabetes.,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Microvascular endothelial hyperpermeability, mainly caused by claudin-5 deficiency, is the initial pathological change that occurs in diabetes-associated cardiovascular disease. The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) exerts unique beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, but the involvement of BHB in promoting the generation of claudin-5 to attenuate cardiac microvascular hyperpermeability in diabetes is poorly understood. METHODS: The effects of BHB on cardiac microvascular endothelial hyperpermeability and claudin-5 generation were evaluated in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and in high glucose (HG)-stimulated human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs). To explore the underlying mechanisms, we also measured beta-catenin nuclear translocation, binding of beta-catenin, histone deacetylase (HDAC)1, HDAC3 and p300 to the Claudin-5 (also known as CLDN5) promoter, interaction between HDAC3 and beta-catenin, and histone acetylation in the Claudin-5 promoter. RESULTS: We found that 10 weeks of BHB treatment promoted claudin-5 generation and antagonised cardiac microvascular endothelial hyperpermeability in rat models of diabetes. Meanwhile, BHB promoted claudin-5 generation and inhibited paracellular permeability in HG-stimulated HCMECs. Specifically, BHB (2 mmol/l) inhibited HG-induced HDAC3 from binding to the Claudin-5 promoter, although nuclear translocation or promoter binding of beta-catenin did not change with BHB treatment. In addition, BHB prevented the binding and co-localisation of HDAC3 to beta-catenin in HG-stimulated HCMECs. Furthermore, using mass spectrometry, acetylated H3K14 (H3K14ac) in the Claudin-5 promoter following BHB treatment was identified, regardless of whether cells were stimulated by HG or not. Although reduced levels of acetylated H3K9 in the Claudin-5 promoter were found following HG stimulation, increased H3K14ac was specifically associated with BHB treatment. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: BHB inhibited HDAC3 and caused acetylation of H3K14 in the Claudin-5 promoter, thereby promoting claudin-5 generation and antagonising diabetes-associated cardiac microvascular hyperpermeability.

In this study, we show that pretreatment with KD or in situ betaOHB suppressed macrophages/microglia activation and the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, while KD downregulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, KD promoted macrophages/microglia transformation from the M1 phenotype to the M2a phenotype following spinal cord injury (SCI) in the in vivo study. Rats in the KD group demonstrated improved behavioral and electrophysiological recovery after SCI when compared to those rats in the standard diet group. The in vitro study performed on BV2 cells indicated that betaOHB inhibited an LPS+ATP-induced inflammatory response and decreased NLRP3 protein levels. Our data demonstrated that pretreatment with KD attenuated neuroinflammation following SCI, probably by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome and shifting the activation state of macrophages/microglia from the M1 to the M2a phenotype. Therefore, the ketone metabolite betaOHB might provide a potential future therapeutic strategy for SCI.",0,spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs); cardiac fibroblasts from 1- to 3-day-old neonatal pups,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells,"mTOR complex 2 pathway activation, up",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,cardiac fibroblasts,Muscle – Cardiac,Cardiac fibroblasts,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypertensive heart disease,Cardiovascular,"interstitial fibrosis, up; cardiac remodeling, up","Fibrosis, up; Cardiac function, up",ketogenic diet; ketone body,Ketogenic diet (endogenous); NS,NS

However, the effects of KD on cardiac remodeling have not been investigated. Our aim was to investigate the effects and the underling mechanisms of KD on cardiac remodeling in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). METHODS: 10-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to normal diet or ketogenic diet for 4 weeks. Then, their blood pressure and cardiac remodeling were assessed. Cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from 1- to 3-day-old neonatal pups. The cells were then cultured with ketone body with or without TGF-beta to investigate the mechanism in vitro. RESULTS: 4 weeks of KD feeding aggravated interstitial fibrosis and cardiac remodeling in SHRs. More interestingly, ketogenic diet feeding increased the activity of mammalian target of rapamyoin (mTOR) complex 2 pathway in the heart of SHRs. In addition, beta-hydroxybutyrate strengthened the progression of TGF-beta-induced fibrosis in isolated cardiac fibroblasts. mTOR inhibition reversed this effect, indicating that ketone body contributes to cardiac fibroblasts via mTOR pathway. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that ketogenic diet may lead to adverse effects on the remodeling in the hypertensive heart, and they underscore the necessity to fully evaluate its reliability before clinical use.",MAP1LC3B; SQSTM1; ULK1; PRKAA1,rats; severe hypoglycemia (SH); SH + GI; Coma; Coma + BHB,animal,Animal – Rat; NS,"autophagic flux, up",Cell Death & Survival,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,autophagosome,Autophagy Structures,Autophagosome,Hypoglycemia,Metabolic & Endocrine,"degenerating cells, down","Cell survival, down",D-BHB,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB
33176578,Effect of beta-Hydroxybutyrate on Autophagy Dynamics During Severe Hypoglycemia and the Hypoglycemic Coma.,"Glucose supply from blood is mandatory for brain functioning and its interruption during acute hypoglycemia or cerebral ischemia leads to brain injury. Alternative substrates to glucose such as the ketone bodies (KB), acetoacetate (AcAc), and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), can be used as energy fuels in the brain during hypoglycemia and prevent neuronal death, but the mechanisms involved are still not well understood. During glucose deprivation adaptive cell responses can be activated such as autophagy, a lysosomal-dependent degradation process, to support cell survival. However, impaired or excessive autophagy can lead to cell dysfunction. We have previously shown that impaired autophagy contributes to neuronal death induced by glucose deprivation in cortical neurons and that D isomer of BHB (D-BHB) reestablishes the autophagic flux increasing viability. Here, we aimed to investigate autophagy dynamics in the brain of rats subjected to severe hypoglycemia (SH) without glucose infusion (GI), severe hypoglycemia followed by GI (SH + GI), and a brief period of hypoglycemic coma followed by GI (Coma). The effect of D-BHB administration after the coma was also tested (Coma + BHB). The transformation of LC3-I to LC3-II and the abundance of autophagy proteins, Beclin 1 (BECN1), ATG7, and ATG12-ATG5 conjugate, were analyzed as an index of autophagosome formation, and the levels of sequestrosome1/p62 (SQSTM1/p62) were determined as a hallmark of autophagic degradation. Data suggest that autophagosomes accumulate in the cortex and the hippocampus of rats after SH, likely due to impaired autophagic degradation. In the cortex, autophagosome accumulation persisted at 6 h after GI in animals exposed to SH but recovered basal levels at 24 h, while in the hippocampus no significant effect was observed. In animals subjected to coma, autophagosome accumulation was observed at 24 h after GI in both regions. D-BHB treatment reduced LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 content and reduced ULK1 phosphorylation by AMPK, suggesting it stimulates the autophagic flux and decreases AMPK activity reducing autophagy initiation. D-BHB also reduced the number of degenerating cells. Together, data suggest different autophagy dynamics after GI in rats subjected to SH or the hypoglycemic coma and support that D-BHB treatment can modulate autophagy dynamics favoring the autophagic flux.",NLRP3; CS,aged mice; long-term high-fat diet; desoxycorticosterone pivalate-challenged mice,animal,Animal – Mouse; NS,"mitochondrial acetylation, down",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction,Cardiovascular,"HFpEF phenotypes, down","HFpEF phenotypes, down",NS,NS,NS
33192276,Targeting Mitochondria-Inflammation Circuit by beta-Hydroxybutyrate Mitigates HFpEF.,"RATIONALE: Over 50% of patients with heart failure have preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), rather than reduced ejection fraction. Complexity of its pathophysiology and the lack of animal models hamper the development of effective therapy for HFpEF. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the metabolic mechanisms of HFpEF and test therapeutic interventions using a novel animal model. METHODS AND RESULTS: By combining the age, long-term high-fat diet, and desoxycorticosterone pivalate challenge in a mouse model, we were able to recapture the myriad features of HFpEF. In these mice, mitochondrial hyperacetylation exacerbated while increasing ketone body availability rescued the phenotypes. The HFpEF mice exhibited overproduction of IL (interleukin)-1beta/IL-18 and tissue fibrosis due to increased assembly of NLPR3 inflammasome on hyperacetylated mitochondria. Increasing beta-hydroxybutyrate level attenuated NLPR3 inflammasome formation and antagonized proinflammatory cytokine-triggered mitochondrial dysfunction and fibrosis. Moreover, beta-hydroxybutyrate downregulated the acetyl-CoA pool and mitochondrial acetylation, partially via activation of CS (citrate synthase) and inhibition of fatty acid uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we identify the interplay of mitochondrial hyperacetylation and inflammation as a key driver in HFpEF pathogenesis, which can be ameliorated by promoting beta-hydroxybutyrate abundance.",BDNF; 0; RNF2; CACNA1C; CREB1; CREBBP,NS,NS,NS,"Ca(2+)/CaMKII/CREB signaling, up",Multiple mechanisms,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,hippocampal neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

Previous studies have explored the molecular mechanisms by which BHBA affects different brain functions, but the effects of BHBA on epigenetic modifications remain elusive. Here, we showed that BHBA enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression by increasing H3K4me3 and decreasing H2AK119ub occupancy at the Bdnf promoters I, II, IV, and VI in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, BHBA treatment induced the upregulation of H3K4me3 and downregulation of H2AK119ub on the global level, both of which were dependent on the L-type calcium channel. Additionally, the BHBA-activated L-type calcium channel subsequently triggered the activation of Ca(2+)/CaMKII/CREB signaling, and promoted the binding of p-CREB and CBP to Bdnf promoters. These results indicate that BHBA regulates cellular signaling and multiple histone modifications to cooperatively modulate BDNF, suggesting a wide range of regulatory effects of BHBA in the central nervous system.",GHRL; GCG; PYY; CCK; INS,87 individuals with obesity (BMI 36.5 +/- 4.0 kg/m(2); age 42.4 +/- 9.7 years),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"modulation of gut hormone secretion, both up and down",Hormonal Regulation,gut,Gastrointestinal (unspecified segment),NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"subjective appetite feelings, no-change","Appetite ratings, no-change",plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) in fasting,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

METHODS: A total of 87 individuals with obesity (BMI: 36.5 +/- 4.0 kg/m(2) ; age: 42.4 +/- 9.7 years; 39 males) underwent 8 weeks of a very low-energy diet. Body weight/composition, plasma concentration of betaHB, and appetite-related hormones (active ghrelin, active glucagon-like peptide 1 [GLP-1], total peptide YY, cholecystokinin [CCK], and insulin) and subjective appetite feelings were measured at baseline and week 9. RESULTS: Participants lost 17.7 +/- 4.1 kg and were ketotic (betaHB: 1.24 +/- 0.82 mmol/L in fasting) at week 9. A negative association was found between betaHB in fasting at week 9 and changes in basal (r = -0.315, P = 0.003) and postprandial ghrelin concentration (r = -0.286, P = 0.008), and a positive association was found with the change in postprandial GLP-1 (r = 0.244, P = 0.025) and CCK (r = 0.228, P = 0.035). No association was seen between betaHB in fasting and changes in peptide YY or subjective feelings of appetite. CONCLUSIONS: betaHB plasma concentration in fasting is associated with lower concentrations of the hunger hormone ghrelin and increased concentrations of the satiety hormones GLP-1 and CCK.

To investigate how aging compromises defense against COVID-19, we developed a model of natural murine beta coronavirus (mCoV) infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-A59 (mCoV-A59) that recapitulated majority of clinical hallmarks of COVID-19. Aged mCoV-A59-infected mice have increased mortality and higher systemic inflammation in the heart, adipose tissue and hypothalamus, including neutrophilia and loss of gammadelta T cells in lungs. Ketogenic diet increases beta-hydroxybutyrate, expands tissue protective gammadelta T cells, deactivates the inflammasome and decreases pathogenic monocytes in lungs of infected aged mice. These data underscore the value of mCoV-A59 model to test mechanism and establishes harnessing of the ketogenic immunometabolic checkpoint as a potential treatment against COVID-19 in the elderly. HIGHLIGHTS: - Natural MHV-A59 mouse coronavirus infection mimics COVID-19 in elderly.- Aged infected mice have systemic inflammation and inflammasome activation.- Murine beta coronavirus (mCoV) infection results in loss of pulmonary gammadelta T cells.- Ketones protect aged mice from infection by reducing inflammation. ETOC BLURB: Elderly have the greatest risk of death from COVID-19. Here, Ryu et al report an aging mouse model of coronavirus infection that recapitulates clinical hallmarks of COVID-19 seen in elderly. The increased severity of infection in aged animals involved increased inflammasome activation and loss of gammadelta T cells that was corrected by ketogenic diet.",0,HFrEF patients; controls,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"betaHB extraction, up",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Heart failure,Cardiovascular,"betaHB extraction, up","Blood ketones (BHB), up","ketone ester (KE, (R)-3-hydroxybutyl(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate) drink",Ketone ester (KE),NS
33303808,Myocardial ketone body utilization in patients with heart failure: The impact of oral ketone ester.,"AIMS: Upregulation of ketone body (beta-hydroxybutyrate, betaHB) utilization has been documented in human end-stage heart failure (HF), but is unclear if this is due to intrinsic cardiac metabolic remodeling or a HF-related catabolic state. This study sought to evaluate the maximal ketone body utilization capacity and its determinants in controls and in patients with moderate HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). METHODS AND RESULTS: 19 HFrEF patients and 9 controls underwent sampling from the arterial circulation (A) and coronary sinus (CS) to measure transmyocardial extraction of energy-providing substrates and oxygen. In a separate experiment, measurements were performed 80-min after oral administration of 25 g of ketone ester (KE, (R)-3-hydroxybutyl(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate) drink in 11 HFrEF and 6 control subjects. There were no statistically significant differences in fasting substrate levels and fractional extractions between HF and controls. Administration of KE increased betaHB by 12.9-fold, revealing an increased ability to utilize ketones in HFrEF as compared to controls (fractional extraction, FE%: 52 vs 39%, p = 0.035). betaHB FE% correlated directly with betaHB myocardial delivery (r = 0.90), LV mass (r = 0.56), LV diameter (r = 0.65) and inversely with LV EF (-0.59) (all p < 0.05). betaHB FE% positively correlated with lactate FE% (p < 0.01), but not with FFA or glucose FE%, arguing against substrate competition. CONCLUSIONS: Acute nutritional ketosis enhances betaHB extraction in patients with HFrEF compared to controls, and this enhancement correlates with degree of cardiac dysfunction and remodeling. Data suggest that subclinical metabolic remodeling occurs early in HF progression. Further studies are needed to determine whether exogenous ketones may have a potential therapeutic role.",TNF; 0; IL1B,Sprague-Dawley rats; single prolonged stress (SPS) rodent PTSD model,animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Other Mammal,"inhibiting systemic TNF-alpha, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,serum,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Post-traumatic stress disorder,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"anxiety-related behaviors, down","Anxiety-like behavior, down",repeated administration of BHB,NS,NS

It has been reported that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), one of the main ketone bodies produced, can have an anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effect. Here, we investigated the potential anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory effects of BHB using a rodent PTSD model, induced by single prolonged stress (SPS). Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were employed in this study. Repeated administration of BHB attenuated SPS-induced anxiety-related behaviors evaluated by the elevated plus maze test. SPS increased the serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. In contrast, BHB administration partially attenuated the increase of serum TNF-alpha. These findings demonstrate that BHB exerts its anxiolytic effects, possibly by inhibiting systemic TNF-alpha. Hence, BHB may be a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of PTSD.",NPPA; SLC16A1; OXCT1,mice; rats,animal,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Rat,"ketone body utilization gene expression, up",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,cardiomyocyte,Muscle – Cardiac,Cardiomyocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Heart failure,Cardiovascular,"left ventricular ejection fraction, up","Ejection fraction, up","hexanoyl-hexyl-3-hydroxybutyrate KE (KE-1) diet; beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3-butanediol monoester (DeltaG; KE-2) diet",Ketone ester (KE); Multi-source,NS

As an initial step toward development of ketone therapies, we investigated the effect of chronic oral ketone ester (KE) supplementation as a prevention or treatment strategy in rodent heart failure models. METHODS: Two independent rodent heart failure models were used for the studies: transverse aortic constriction/myocardial infarction (MI) in mice and post-MI remodeling in rats. Seventy-five mice underwent a prevention treatment strategy with a KE comprised of hexanoyl-hexyl-3-hydroxybutyrate KE (KE-1) diet, and 77 rats were treated in either a prevention or treatment regimen using a commercially available beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3-butanediol monoester (DeltaG; KE-2) diet. RESULTS: The KE-1 diet in mice elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate levels during nocturnal feeding, whereas the KE-2 diet in rats induced ketonemia throughout a 24-hour period. The KE-1 diet preventive strategy attenuated development of left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling post-transverse aortic constriction/MI (left ventricular ejection fraction+/-SD, 36+/-8 in vehicle versus 45+/-11 in KE-1; P=0.016). The KE-2 diet therapeutic approach also attenuated left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling post-MI (left ventricular ejection fraction, 41+/-11 in MI-vehicle versus 61+/-7 in MI-KE-2; P<0.001). In addition, ventricular weight, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, and the expression of ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) were significantly attenuated in the KE-2-treated MI group. However, treatment with KE-2 did not influence cardiac fibrosis post-MI. The myocardial expression of the ketone transporter and 2 ketolytic enzymes was significantly increased in rats fed KE-2 diet along with normalization of myocardial ATP levels to sham values. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic oral supplementation with KE was effective in both prevention and treatment of heart failure in 2 preclinical animal models. In addition, our results indicate that treatment with KE reprogrammed the expression of genes involved in ketone body utilization and normalized myocardial ATP production following MI, consistent with provision of an auxiliary fuel. These findings provide rationale for the assessment of KEs as a treatment for patients with heart failure.",CKM; CCL2,moderately active healthy young adults,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"blood beta-OHB concentration, up",Metabolic Regulation,muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Muscle damage,Musculoskeletal & Connective Tissue,"recovery of muscle performance, no-change","Motor function, no-change",ketone monoester supplement,Ketone ester (KE),NS

Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, independent group design, 20 moderately active healthy young adults consumed 360 mg per kg(-1) bodyweight of a ketone monoester (KET) or energy-matched carbohydrate (CON) supplement twice daily following eccentric exercise (drop jumps). Maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC) torque, counter-movement jump (CMJ) height, and muscle soreness were measured before (PRE), and immediately (POST), 24 h and 48 h post-exercise. Blood samples were collected for analysis of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), creatine kinase (CK), and select pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Results: Peak blood beta-OHB concentration after supplement intake was greater (P < 0.001) in KET (4.4 +/- 0.8 mM) vs. CON (0.4 +/- 0.3 mM). Exercise increased CK concentration at 24 h and 48 h vs. PRE (time: P < 0.001) with no difference between KET and CON. Exercise reduced MIVC (KET: -19.9 +/- 14.6; CON: -22.6 +/- 11.1%) and CMJ (KET: -11.0 +/- 7.5; CON: -13.0 +/- 8.7%) at POST relative PRE; however, there was no difference between KET and CON on the recovery of MIVC at 24 h (KET: -15.4 +/- 20.4; CON: -18.7 +/- 20.1%) or 48 h (KET: -7.2 +/- 21.2; CON: -11.8 +/- 20.2%), or CMJ at 24 h (KET: -9.2 +/- 11.5; CON: -13.4 +/- 10.8) or 48 h (KET: -12.5 +/- 12.4; CON: -9.1 +/- 11.7). Muscle soreness was increased during post-exercise recovery (time: P < 0.001) with no differences between KET and CON. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was greater (group: P = 0.007) in CON (236 +/- 11 pg/mL) vs. KET (187 +/- 11 pg/mL).

33430235,14-Day Ketone Supplementation Lowers Glucose and Improves Vascular Function in Obesity: A Randomized Crossover Trial.,"CONTEXT: Postprandial hyperglycemia increases systemic inflammation and is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A ketone monoester (KME) drink containing beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) rapidly lowers plasma glucose, which may be a strategy protecting against postprandial hyperglycemia. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that KME would attenuate 2-hour postprandial glucose, lower systemic inflammation, and improve vascular function in adults with obesity. METHODS: In a randomized crossover design, 14 participants with obesity (age = 56 +/- 12 years; body mass index = 32.8 +/- 7.7 kg/m2) consumed KME (12 g beta-OHB) or placebo 15 minutes prior to each meal for 14 days with all meals provided and matched between conditions. Postprandial glycemia was assessed by continuous glucose monitoring. Vascular function and inflammation were assessed before and after treatment periods. RESULTS: Postprandial glucose was 8.0% lower in KME versus placebo (g = 0.735; P = 0.011) and 24-hour average glucose reduced by 7.8% (g = 0.686; P = 0.0001). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation increased from 6.2 +/- 1.5% to 8.9 +/- 3.3% in KME (g = 1.05; P = 0.0004) with no changes in placebo (condition x time interaction, P = 0.004). There were no changes in plasma cytokines; however, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocyte caspase-1 activation was lower following KME supplementation versus placebo (stimulation x condition x time interaction; P = 0.004). The KME supplement was well tolerated by participants and adherence to the supplementation regimen was very high. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with obesity, 14 days of premeal KME supplementation improves glucose control, enhances vascular function, and may reduce cellular inflammation. KME supplementation may be a viable, nonpharmacological approach to improving and protecting vascular health in people with heightened cardiometabolic risk.",0,non-fasted mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"feedback inhibition of glycolysis, down",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan","oral ketone ester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (oral KE-gavage, 3 mg KE/g of body weight)",Multi-source,NS
33467454,Ingested Ketone Ester Leads to a Rapid Rise of Acetyl-CoA and Competes with Glucose Metabolism in the Brain of Non-Fasted Mice.,"The role of ketone bodies in the cerebral energy homeostasis of neurological diseases has begun to attract recent attention particularly in acute neurological diseases. In ketogenic therapies, ketosis is achieved by either a ketogenic diet or by the administration of exogenous ketone bodies. The oral ingestion of the ketone ester (KE), (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate, is a new method to generate rapid and significant ketosis (i.e., above 6 mmol/L) in humans. KE is hydrolyzed into beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) and its precursor 1,3-butanediol. Here, we investigate the effect of oral KE administration (3 mg KE/g of body weight) on brain metabolism of non-fasted mice using liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry. Ketosis (Cmax = 6.83 +/- 0.19 mmol/L) was obtained at Tmax = 30 min after oral KE-gavage. We found that betaHB uptake into the brain strongly correlated with the plasma betaHB concentration and was preferentially distributed in the neocortex. We showed for the first time that oral KE led to an increase of acetyl-CoA and citric cycle intermediates in the brain of non-fasted mice. Furthermore, we found that the increased level of acetyl-CoA inhibited glycolysis by a feedback mechanism and thus competed with glucose under physiological conditions. The brain pharmacodynamics of this oral KE strongly suggest that this agent should be considered for acute neurological diseases.",0,Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"spike-wave discharges (SWDs) number, down","Seizure activity, down",beta-hydroxybutyrate salt + medium chain triglyceride (KSMCT),MCT / Medium-chain fats,NS
33505242,Enhancement of Ketone Supplements-Evoked Effect on Absence Epileptic Activity by Co-Administration of Uridine in Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk Rats.,"Both uridine and exogenous ketone supplements decreased the number of spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in a rat model of human absence epilepsy Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats. It has been suggested that alleviating influence of both uridine and ketone supplements on absence epileptic activity may be modulated by A(1) type adenosine receptors (A(1)Rs). The first aim was to determine whether intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of a specific A(1)R antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX; 0.2 mg/kg) and a selective adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist (7-(2-phenylethyl)-5-amino-2-(2-furyl)-pyrazolo-[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo [1,5-c]pyrimidine) (SCH 58261; 0.5 mg/kg) have a modulatory influence on i.p. 1000 mg/kg uridine-evoked effects on SWD number in WAG/Rij rats. The second aim was to assess efficacy of a sub-effective dose of uridine (i.p. 250 mg/kg) combined with beta-hydroxybutyrate salt + medium chain triglyceride (KSMCT; 2.5 g/kg, gavage) on absence epilepsy. DPCPX completely abolished the i.p. 1000 mg/kg uridine-evoked alleviating effect on SWD number whereas SCH 58261 was ineffective, confirming the A(1)R mechanism. Moreover, the sub-effective dose of uridine markedly enhanced the effect of KSMCT (2.5 g/kg, gavage) on absence epileptic activity. These results demonstrate the anti-epilepsy benefits of co-administrating uridine and exogenous ketone supplements as a means to treat absence epilepsy.",0,Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",KEMCT (1:1 mix of ketone ester/KE and medium-chain triglyceride/MCT oil) by oral gavage,Multi-source,D-BHB
33547753,Age- and Sex-Dependent Modulation of Exogenous Ketone Supplement-Evoked Effects on Blood Glucose and Ketone Body Levels in Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk Rats.,"In certain disease states, such as epilepsy, the elevation of blood ketone levels with ketogenic diets (KDs) has beneficial effects, while exogenous ketone supplements (EKSs) were shown to increase the level of blood ketone bodies (such as beta-hydroxybutyrate, betaHB) and decrease blood glucose levels without dietary restrictions. It has been suggested that ketone body and glucose utilization of the body may be modified by age and gender resulting in changes in blood betaHB and glucose levels, but it was not investigated through several months yet. Thus, we investigated whether the effect of an EKS on blood betaHB and glucose level is modulated by age and sex in Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats, a model animal of human absence epilepsy. We used KEMCT (1:1 mix of ketone ester/KE and medium-chain triglyceride/MCT oil) by oral gavage in female and male WAG/Rij rats. Animals were fed with standard diet, which was supplemented by KEMCT (2.5 g/kg) once per month by oral gavage for 17 months. One hour after KEMCT treatment, changes in blood R-beta-hydroxybutyrate (R-betaHB) and glucose levels were measured. KEMCT gavage significantly increased blood R-betaHB and decreased blood glucose levels, in both male and female rats, compared with the controls. In male rats, the KEMCT-induced increase in blood R-betaHB levels was lower at the 7th and 8th months and higher at the 16th and 17th months, compared with the results at the 1st month. KEMCT-generated increase in R-betaHB levels was higher in female rats, compared with male rats between the 2nd and 11th months, but older (between the 14th and 17th months) female rats showed lower levels than males. KEMCT gavage induced significantly lower glucose levels at the 4th, 9th, 10th, 12th, and 13th months in both sexes, but between the 14th and 17th months, only males showed significantly lower levels, compared with the results at the 1st month. KEMCT treatment induced lower blood glucose levels in female than in male rats between the 1st and 8th months, but higher glucose levels were measured in female rats at the 17th month than in males. These findings suggest that age and sex can modify the EKS-evoked effects on blood R-betaHB and glucose concentrations.",BDNF,C2C12; C6; aged mice; elderly people,in vitro; animal; human,In vitro – Immortalized cell line; Animal – Mouse; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"BHB release, up",Metabolic Regulation,skeletal muscle,Skeletal muscle,C6 cells,Unspecified / Mixed,Cell line (origin unclear),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"skeletal muscle function, up; cognitive function, up","Motor function, up; Cognition, up",exercise-induced BHB,NS,NS

In particular, previous studies have suggested that exercise-induced beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) release might improve skeletal muscle and cognitive function, but to date these studies have been limited to cell and animal models. Therefore, we aimed to determine how an exercise-induced increase in BHB affects skeletal muscle and cognitive function at a cellular level, in an animal model, and in humans. The effects of BHB on skeletal muscle and cognitive function were determined by treating C2C12 and C6 cell lines with BHB, and by measuring the skeletal muscle and serum BHB concentrations in aged mice after endurance or resistance exercise. In addition, serum BHB concentration was measured before and after high-speed band exercise in elderly people, and its relationships with muscle and cognitive function were analyzed. We found that BHB increased cell viability and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression level in C6 cells, and endurance exercise, but not resistance exercise, increased the muscle BHB concentration in aged mice. Furthermore, the BHB concentration was positively related to skeletal muscle and cognitive function. Exercise did not increase the serum BHB concentration in the elderly people and BHB did not correlate with cognitive function, but after excluding the five people with the highest preexisting serum concentrations of BHB, the BHB concentrations of the remaining participants were increased by exercise, and the concentration showed a tendency toward a positive correlation with cognitive function. Thus, the BHB released by skeletal muscle following endurance exercise may improve muscle and cognitive function in animals and humans.",0,purified peripheral blood monocytes-derived macrophages,human; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,peripheral blood,Blood,macrophages,Hematopoietic / Immune,Macrophages,NLRP3 inflammasome,Cytosol,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

Purified peripheral blood monocytes were differentiated into macrophages and were treated with ethanol, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and sodium acetate, and stimulated with P. brasiliensis yeast cells and evaluated for their phenotypic characteristics, functional activity, and capability to induce T cells activation/differentiation. We found that the ethanol treatment diminished the expression of HLA-AB, HLA-DR, CD80, and CD86, modulating the expression of dectin-1, as well as Syk phosphorylation. The ethanol treatment increased the phagocytic activity, expression of CD206, and IL-10 production; however, reduced ROS production, fungicidal activity, caspase-1 cleavage, and IL-1beta and IL-6 production. Our data also showed that the presence of ethanol reduced the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells and increased the frequency of Th2 cells. Our results indicated that ethanol exposure could suppress effector function of macrophages, possibly leading to the polarization of M2 macrophages. The ethanol modulates the expression of costimulatory and antigen-presentation molecules and interferes with the NLRP3 inflammasome. Altogether, these alterations affect the development of the adaptive response, decreasing the frequency of IL-17, IL-22, and IFN- gamma producing cells, and increasing the frequency of IL-4 producing cells. Therefore, exposure to ethanol can impair the capability of macrophages to exert their effector functions and activate the acquired response related to resistance to P. brasiliensis infection.",GHRL; GCG; PYY,13 healthy males and females (age: 23.6 +/- 2.4 years; body mass index: 25.7 +/- 3.2 kg.m(-2)),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"appetite-regulating hormones, down",Hormonal Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"perceived appetite, no-change; ad libitum energy intake (2 h post-exercise), no-change","Appetite, no-change; Food intake, no-change",Ketone monoester (KET) (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate,Ketone ester (KE),D-BHB

In a randomized crossover trial, 13 healthy males and females (age: 23.6 +/- 2.4 years; body mass index: 25.7 +/- 3.2 kg.m(-2)) completed an exercise session @ 70% VO(2peak) for 60 min on a cycling ergometer and consumed either: (1) Ketone monoester (KET) (0.5 g.kg(-1) pre-exercise + 0.25 g.kg(-1) post-exercise); or (2) isocaloric dextrose control (DEX). Transient ketonaemia was achieved with betaHB concentrations reaching 5.0 mM (range 4.1-6.1 mM) during the post-exercise period. Relative to the dextrose condition, acyl-ghrelin (P = 0.002) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (P = 0.038) were both reduced by acute ketosis immediately following exercise. AUC for acyl-ghrelin was lower in KET compared to DEX (P = 0.001), however there were no differences in AUC for GLP-1 (P = 0.221) or PYY (P = 0.654).

Herein, we reported that prolonged KD exposure induced cardiac fibrosis. In rats, KD or frequent deep fasting decreased mitochondrial biogenesis, reduced cell respiration, and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis. Mechanistically, increased levels of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), an HDAC2 inhibitor, promoted histone acetylation of the Sirt7 promoter and activated Sirt7 transcription. This in turn inhibited the transcription of mitochondrial ribosome-encoding genes and mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis. Exogenous beta-OHB administration mimicked the effects of a KD in rats. Notably, increased beta-OHB levels and SIRT7 expression, decreased mitochondrial biogenesis, and increased cardiac fibrosis were detected in human atrial fibrillation heart tissues.

While KEbetaHB supplementation has a glucose-lowering effect in adults with obesity, its impact on glucose control in other insulin-resistant states is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to investigate the effect of KEbetaHB-supplemented drink on plasma glucose in adults with prediabetes. The secondary objective was to determine its impact on plasma glucoregulatory peptides. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial [called CETUS (Cross-over randomizEd Trial of beta-hydroxybUtyrate in prediabeteS)] included 18 adults [67% men, mean age = 55 y, mean BMI (kg/m2) = 28.4] with prediabetes (glycated hemoglobin between 5.7% and 6.4% and/or fasting plasma glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL). Participants were randomly assigned to receive KEbetaHB-supplemented and placebo drinks in a crossover sequence (washout period of 7-10 d between the drinks). Blood samples were collected from 0 to 150 min, at intervals of 30 min. Paired-samples t tests were used to investigate the change in the outcome variables [beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), glucose, and glucoregulatory peptides] after both drinks. Repeated measures analyses were conducted to determine the change in concentrations of the prespecified outcomes over time. RESULTS: Blood betaHB concentrations increased to 3.5 mmol/L within 30 minutes after KEbetaHB supplementation. Plasma glucose AUC was significantly lower after KEbetaHB supplementation than after the placebo [mean difference (95% CI): -59 (-85.3, -32.3) mmol/L x min]. Compared with the placebo, KEbetaHB supplementation led to significantly greater AUCs for plasma insulin [0.237 (0.044, 0.429) nmol/L x min], C-peptide [0.259 (0.114, 0.403) nmol/L x min], and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide [0.243 (0.085, 0.401) nmol/L x min], with no significant differences in the AUCs for amylin, glucagon, and glucagon-like peptide 1. CONCLUSIONS: Ingestion of the KEbetaHB-supplemented drink acutely increased the blood betaHB concentrations and lowered the plasma glucose concentrations in adults with prediabetes.

33627428,Randomized crossover trial of a modified ketogenic diet in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Brain energy metabolism is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which may be mitigated by a ketogenic diet. We conducted a randomized crossover trial to determine whether a 12-week modified ketogenic diet improved cognition, daily function, or quality of life in a hospital clinic of AD patients. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with clinically confirmed diagnoses of AD to a modified ketogenic diet or usual diet supplemented with low-fat healthy-eating guidelines and enrolled them in a single-phase, assessor-blinded, two-period crossover trial (two 12-week treatment periods, separated by a 10-week washout period). Primary outcomes were mean within-individual changes in the Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination - III (ACE-III) scale, AD Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) inventory, and Quality of Life in AD (QOL-AD) questionnaire over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes considered changes in cardiovascular risk factors and adverse effects. RESULTS: We randomized 26 patients, of whom 21 (81%) completed the ketogenic diet; only one withdrawal was attributed to the ketogenic diet. While on the ketogenic diet, patients achieved sustained physiological ketosis (12-week mean beta-hydroxybutyrate level: 0.95 +/- 0.34 mmol/L). Compared with usual diet, patients on the ketogenic diet increased their mean within-individual ADCS-ADL (+ 3.13 +/- 5.01 points, P = 0.0067) and QOL-AD (+ 3.37 +/- 6.86 points, P = 0.023) scores; the ACE-III also increased, but not significantly (+ 2.12 +/- 8.70 points, P = 0.24). Changes in cardiovascular risk factors were mostly favourable, and adverse effects were mild. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized trial to investigate the impact of a ketogenic diet in patients with uniform diagnoses of AD. High rates of retention, adherence, and safety appear to be achievable in applying a 12-week modified ketogenic diet to AD patients. Compared with a usual diet supplemented with low-fat healthy-eating guidelines, patients on the ketogenic diet improved in daily function and quality of life, two factors of great importance to people living with dementia.

33646860,The regulatory enzymes and protein substrates for the lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation pathway.,"Metabolism-mediated epigenetic changes represent an adapted mechanism for cellular signaling, in which lysine acetylation and methylation have been the historical focus of interest. We recently discovered a beta-hydroxybutyrate-mediated epigenetic pathway that couples metabolism to gene expression. However, its regulatory enzymes and substrate proteins remain unknown, hindering its functional study. Here, we report that the acyltransferase p300 can catalyze the enzymatic addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate to lysine (Kbhb), while histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC2 enzymatically remove Kbhb. We demonstrate that p300-dependent histone Kbhb can directly mediate in vitro transcription. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of Kbhb substrates in mammalian cells has identified 3248 Kbhb sites on 1397 substrate proteins. The dependence of histone Kbhb on p300 argues that enzyme-catalyzed acylation is the major mechanism for nuclear Kbhb. Our study thus reveals key regulatory elements for the Kbhb pathway, laying a foundation for studying its roles in diverse cellular processes.",0,endurance-trained adults; n=10 males; n=9 females; V̇O2peak=57±8 mL/kg/min,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"cardiorespiratory stress, up",General Stress Responses,cardiorespiratory system,Systemic/Whole organism,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"performance, no-change","Cognitive performance, no-change",ketone monoester (KE) supplement (600 mg/kg body mass),Ketone ester (KE),NS

The limited studies to date have yielded equivocal data, likely due in part to differences in dosing strategy, increase in blood ketones, and participant training status. Using a randomized, double-blind, counterbalanced design, we examined the effect of ingesting a ketone monoester (KE) supplement (600 mg/kg body mass) or flavour-matched placebo in endurance-trained adults (n = 10 males, n = 9 females; V̇O(2peak) = 57 +/- 8 mL/kg/min). Participants performed a 30-min cycling bout at ventilatory threshold intensity (71 +/- 3% V̇O(2peak)), followed 15 min later by a 3 kJ/kg body mass time-trial. KE versus placebo ingestion increased plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration before exercise (3.9 +/- 1.0 vs 0.2 +/- 0.3 mM, p < 0.0001, d(z) = 3.4), ventilation (77 +/- 17 vs 71 +/- 15 L/min, p < 0.0001, d(z) = 1.3) and heart rate (155 +/- 11 vs 150 +/- 11 beats/min, p < 0.001, d(z) = 1.2) during exercise, and rating of perceived exertion at the end of exercise (15.4 +/- 1.6 vs 14.5 +/- 1.2, p < 0.01, d(z) = 0.85). Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration remained higher after KE vs placebo ingestion before the time-trial (3.5 +/- 1.0 vs 0.3 +/- 0.2 mM, p < 0.0001, d(z) = 3.1), but performance was not different (KE: 16:25 +/- 2:50 vs placebo: 16:06 +/- 2:40 min:s, p = 0.20; d(z) = 0.31). We conclude that acute ingestion of a relatively large KE bolus dose increased markers of cardiorespiratory stress during submaximal exercise in endurance-trained participants. Novelty: Limited studies have yielded equivocal data regarding exercise responses after acute ketone body supplementation. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced design, we found that ingestion of a large bolus dose of a commercial ketone monoester supplement increased markers of cardiorespiratory stress during cycling at ventilatory threshold intensity in endurance-trained adults.",0,rat brain slices; caudal solitary complex (cSC) cells,animal; in vitro,Multi-model; In vitro – Primary cells,"superoxide production, down",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,brainstem,Brain/CNS,O2-sensitive neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Central nervous system oxygen toxicity,Toxicology / Poisoning,"onset of CNS-OT, down","Seizure activity, down",50:50 mixture of ketone salts (KS) dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate + acetoacetate,Multi-source,racemic

Importantly, ketone supplementation has been shown to delay onset of CNS-OT in rats by approximately 600% in comparison with control groups (D'Agostino DP, Pilla R, Held HE, Landon CS, Puchowicz M, Brunengraber H, Ari C, Arnold P, Dean JB. Am J Physiol Regu Integr Comp Physiol 304: R829-R836, 2013). We have tested the hypothesis that ketone body supplementation inhibits ROS production during exposure to hyperoxygenation in rat brainstem cells. We measured the rate of cellular superoxide ([Formula: see text]) production in the caudal solitary complex (cSC) in rat brain slices using a fluorogenic dye, dihydroethidium (DHE), during exposure to control O(2) (0.4 ATA) followed by 1-2 h of normobaric oxygen (NBO(2)) (0.95 ATA) and HBO(2) (1.95, and 4.95 ATA) hyperoxia, with and without a 50:50 mixture of ketone salts (KS) dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate + acetoacetate. All levels of hyperoxia tested stimulated [Formula: see text] production similarly in cSC cells and coexposure to 5 mM KS during hyperoxia significantly blunted the rate of increase in DHE fluorescence intensity during exposure to hyperoxia. Not all cells tested produced [Formula: see text] at the same rate during exposure to control O(2) and hyperoxygenation; cells that increased [Formula: see text] production by >25% during hyperoxia in comparison with baseline were inhibited by KS, whereas cells that did not reach that threshold during hyperoxia were unaffected by KS. These findings support the hypothesis that ketone supplementation decreases the steady-state concentrations of superoxide produced during exposure to NBO(2) and HBO(2) hyperoxia.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Exposure of rat medullary tissue slices to levels of O(2) that mimic those that cause seizures in rats stimulates cellular superoxide ([Formula: see text]) production to varying degrees. Cellular [Formula: see text] generation in the caudal solitary complex is variable during exposure to control O(2) and hyperoxia and significantly decreases during ketone supplementation.

The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate exhibits various cardiovascular protective effects, however its mechanism remains to be clarified. In the current study, the effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate on cardiac microvascular fibrosis and COL4 accumulation were evaluated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and in high glucose (HG) treated human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs). Generations of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), and the amount of nitrotyrosine (NT) were measured in vivo and in vitro. Ten weeks of beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment (160, 200 and 240 mg/kg/d) attenuated cardiac microvascular fibrosis and inhibited cardiac COL4 generation and microvascular distribution in diabetic rats. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate promoted cardiac Cu/Zn-SOD generation and reduced NT content, without reducing iNOS generation in diabetic rats. In HCMECs, stimulation with HG induced excess generation of COL4 via peroxynitrite. beta-Hydroxybutyrate treatment (2, 4, 6 mM) attenuated HG-stimulated COL4 accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Similarly, 4 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate promoted Cu/Zn-SOD generation and reduced NT content, without affecting excess iNOS generation in HG-stimulated HCMECs. In conclusion, this study showed that beta-hydroxybutyrate promoted Cu/Zn-SOD generation, reduced peroxynitrite and inhibited cardiac microvascular COL4 accumulation in diabetes.",0; SLC5A8; MAPK1; CREB1; NOS3,MCAO model rats; neuronal cells (OGD),animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells,"SMCT1 upregulation and Erk/CREB/eNOS pathway activation, up",Vascular Function & Angiogenesis,brain,Brain/CNS,neuronal cells,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Stroke,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"neurological score, up; infarct volume, down","Neurological deficit score, up; Infarct size, down",injected into the lateral ventricle,Intraperitoneal BHB,NS

Increasing evidence indicates that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) exerts beneficial effects in treating stroke, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we injected different doses of BHB into the lateral ventricle in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model rats and neuronal cells were treated with different doses of BHB followed by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). We found that a moderate dose of BHB enhanced mitochondrial complex I respiratory chain complex I activity, reduced oxidative stress, inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis, improved neurological scores, and reduced infarct volume after ischemia. We further showed that the effects of BHB were achieved by upregulating the dedicated BHB transporter SMCT1 and activating the Erk/CREB/eNOS pathway.

33774275,"The ketogenic diet raises brain oxygen levels, attenuates postictal hypoxia, and protects against learning impairments.","OBJECTIVES: A prolonged vasoconstriction/hypoperfusion/hypoxic event follows self-terminating focal seizures. The ketogenic diet (KD) has demonstrated efficacy as a metabolic treatment for intractable epilepsy and other disorders but its effect on local brain oxygen levels is completely unknown. This study investigated the effects of the KD on tissue oxygenation in the hippocampus before and after electrically elicited (kindled) seizures and whether it could protect against a seizure-induced learning impairment. We also examined the effects of the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as a potential underlying mechanism. METHODS: Male and female rats were given access to one of three diet protocols 2 weeks prior to the initiation of seizures: KD, caloric restricted standard chow, and ad libitum standard chow. Dorsal hippocampal oxygen levels were measured prior to initiation of diets as well as before and after a 10-day kindling paradigm. Male rats were then tested on a novel object recognition task to assess postictal learning impairments. In a separate cohort, BHB was administered 30 min prior to seizure elicitation to determine whether it influenced oxygen dynamics. RESULTS: The KD increased dorsal hippocampal oxygen levels, ameliorated postictal hypoxia, and prevented postictal learning impairments. Acute BHB administration did not alter oxygen levels before or after seizures. INTERPRETATION: The ketogenic diet raised brain oxygen levels and attenuated severe postictal hypoxia likely through a mechanism independent of ketosis and shows promise as a non-pharmacological treatment to prevent the postictal state.",BDH1; PC; GLUD1,NS,NS,NS,"metabolism, up",Metabolic Regulation,prefrontal cortex (PFC),Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Acute stress reaction,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"struggling behaviors, up","Behavior, up",Exogenous administration of BHB,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
33807731,Acutely increased beta-hydroxybutyrate plays a role in the prefrontal cortex to escape stressful conditions during the acute stress response.,"Ketone bodies can be increased in the blood under certain physiological conditions, but their role under such conditions remains to be clarified. In the present study, we found the increment and usage of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during acute stress. BHB levels increased in the blood and PFC after 30-min acute immobilization stress, and BHB dehydrogenase 1 increased in the PFC simultaneously, but not in the hippocampus. Moreover, increased levels of acetyl-CoA, pyruvate carboxylase, and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 were found in the PFC, implicating the metabolism of increased BHB in the brain. Thus, we checked the levels of glutamate, glutamine, and GABA and found increased levels of glutamate and glutamine in the stressed group compared with that in the control group in the PFC. Exogenous administration of BHB enhanced struggling behaviors under stressful conditions. Our results suggest that the metabolism of BHB from peripheral blood in the PFC may contribute to acute stress responses to escape stressful conditions.",0,22 healthy male and female adolescents,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"induce ketosis, up",Metabolic Regulation,bone,Bone,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"bone density, no-change","Bone density, no-change",exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate salts,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
33852195,The Effect of Exogenous Beta-Hydroxybutyrate Salt Supplementation on Metrics of Safety and Health in Adolescents.,"The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, very low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein diet that will induce a state of ketosis, but because of its restrictive nature, it may be difficult to adhere to, especially in adolescents. Supplementing with exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate salts may induce a state of temporary ketosis without any undesirable side effects, thereby promoting the benefits of ketosis and minimizing adherence requirements to a ketogenic diet. To date, beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation in healthy adolescents has not been explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the safety of exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate salt supplementation in a healthy adolescent population. In the present study, 22 healthy male and female adolescents consumed 3.75 g of beta-hydroxybutyrate salts or maltodextrin placebo twice daily for 90 days. Comprehensive blood safety analysis, bone densitometry, happiness and emotional intelligence surveys, and blood pressure were assessed at Pre, Day 45, and Day 90. There were no significant differences detected in subjects supplementing with beta-hydroxybutyrate salts, indicating that exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate salts had no detrimental impact on fasting blood safety metrics, bone density, happiness, emotional intelligence, or blood pressure.

METHODS: We examined 10 healthy young men on three separate occasions using a placebo (PBO)-controlled crossover design. A KE versus taste-matched isovolumetric and isocaloric 50% GLU and taste-matched isovolumetric PBO vehicle was orally administered. Our main outcome measures were plasma concentrations of AG, UAG, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 along with appetite sensation scores assessed by visual analogue scale. RESULTS: KE ingestion resulted in an average peak beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration of 5.5 mM. AG and UAG were lowered by approximately 25% following both KE and GLU intake compared with PBO. In the case of AG, the differences were -52.1 (-79.4, -24.8) for KE and -48.4 (-75.4, -21.5) pg/mL for GLU intake (P < .01). Concentrations of AG remained lower with KE but returned to baseline and were comparable with PBO levels after GLU intake. GLP-1, GIP, gastrin and cholecystokinin were not affected by KE ingestion. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the suppressive effects on appetite sensation scores associated with hyperketonaemia are more probable to be mediated through reduced ghrelin concentrations than by increased activity of cholecystokinin, gastrin, GIP or GLP-1.",0,overweight and obese adults,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"ketosis, up",Metabolic Regulation,adipose tissue,Adipose tissue,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Multi-disease,"body mass, down; whole body fat, down; lean mass, down; mid-thigh muscle cross-sectional area, down; visceral adipose tissue, down; subcutaneous adipose tissue, down","Body weight, down; Body fat mass, down; Lean mass, down; Muscle cross-sectional area, down",racemic BHB-salt,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic
33871793,"The Effects of a 6-Week Controlled, Hypocaloric Ketogenic Diet, With and Without Exogenous Ketone Salts, on Body Composition Responses.","Background: Ketogenic diets (KDs) that elevate beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) promote weight and fat loss. Exogenous ketones, such as ketone salts (KS), also elevate BHB concentrations with the potential to protect against muscle loss during caloric restriction. Whether augmenting ketosis with KS impacts body composition responses to a well-formulated KD remains unknown. Purpose: To explore the effects of energy-matched, hypocaloric KD feeding (<50 g carbohydrates/day; 1.5 g/kg/day protein), with and without the inclusion of KS, on weight loss and body composition responses. Methods: Overweight and obese adults were provided a precisely defined hypocaloric KD (~75% of energy expenditure) for 6 weeks. In a double-blind manner, subjects were randomly assigned to receive ~24 g/day of a racemic BHB-salt (KD + KS; n = 12) or placebo (KD + PL; n = 13). A matched comparison group (n = 12) was separately assigned to an isoenergetic/isonitrogenous low-fat diet (LFD). Body composition parameters were assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging. Results: The KD induced nutritional ketosis (>1.0 mM capillary BHB) throughout the study (p < 0.001), with higher fasting concentrations observed in KD + KS than KD + PL for the first 2 weeks (p < 0.05). There were decreases in body mass, whole body fat and lean mass, mid-thigh muscle cross-sectional area, and both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues (p < 0.001), but no group differences between the two KDs or with the LFD. Urine nitrogen excretion was significantly higher in KD + PL than LFD (p < 0.01) and trended higher in KD + PL compared to KD + KS (p = 0.076), whereas the nitrogen excretion during KD + KS was similar to LFD (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Energy-matched hypocaloric ketogenic diets favorably affected body composition but were not further impacted by administration of an exogenous BHB-salt that augmented ketosis. The trend for less nitrogen loss with the BHB-salt, if manifested over a longer period of time, may contribute to preserved lean mass.",0,prediabetes; type 2 diabetes mellitus,human,NS,"GH promotion of ketogenesis, up",Multiple mechanisms,liver,Liver,pancreatic alpha cells,Pancreatic Endocrine,α-cells (islet),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Prediabetes; Type 2 diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"ketogenesis, up","Ketone utilization, up",NS,NS,NS

On the other hand, growth hormone (GH) stimulates peripheral lipolysis and provides free fatty acids (FFA) for ketogenesis; however, it remains unresolved whether GH directly impacts hepatic ketogenesis. We aimed to investigate the role of physiologic GH levels in promoting ketogenesis in prediabetic or type 2 diabetic patients under empagliflozin treatment. METHODS: Sixteen patients (11 women, 5 men) with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus, aged 55.6 +/- 4.7 years and with a mean BMI of 30.7 +/- 4.8 kg/m(2) and HbA1c 7.1 +/- 1.6% (means +/- SD), participated in this study. All of them were submitted to three mixed-meal tests: they received placebo at -60 min (test 1), and empagliflozin 25 mg (test 2, 21st day) and empagliflozin 25 mg plus pegvisomant 30 mg were administered subcutaneously 36 h before (test 3, 28th day). After test 1, all patients were instructed to take empagliflozin 25 mg daily. RESULTS: The empagliflozin treatment decreased the plasma concentrations of glucose by 14% (P < 0.01), FFA by 23% (P < 0.01), and the insulin/glucagon ratio by 26% (P < 0.01), and it increased beta-hydroxybutyrate by 44% (P < 0.05). The GH receptor block by pegvisomant restored the plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate to baseline levels.

Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective chemotherapeutic drug, but limited by serious irreversible cardiotoxicity. However, whether BHB can protect from DOX-induced cardiotoxicity remains unknown. Methods and Results: C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with DOX to induce cardiac toxicity and intragastrically administered into BHB for treatment. They were randomly divided into three groups, namely a sham group (Sham), a doxorubicin group (DOX), and a doxorubicin+beta-Hydroxybutyrate group (DOX + BHB). Echocardiography and pathological staining were performed to evaluate cardiac function and fibrosis. H9c2 cardiomyocyte was treated with DOX or BHB for in vitro experiments. Cell apoptosis and ROS were determined by flow cytometry. BHB significantly restored DOX-induced cardiac function decline and partially prevented cardiac reverse remodeling, characterized by increased cell size and decreased fibrosis. In vitro, BHB treatment decreased cellular injury and apoptosis. Also, BHB alleviated oxidative stress level and increased mitochondrial membrane potential. Conclusion: Our results suggested that BHB could protected from DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting cell apoptosis and oxidative stress and maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity.",SLC16A1,mice; liver Mct1 gene deletion; neuronal Mct1 gene deletion; glial Mct1 gene deletion,animal,Animal – Mouse,"ketone body transport, down",Ion & Nutrient Transport,liver,Liver,neuronal cells; glial cells,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,membrane,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"food anticipatory activity, down","Locomotor activity, down",NS,NS,NS
33944942,The Hepatic Monocarboxylate Transporter 1 (MCT1) Contributes to the Regulation of Food Anticipation in Mice.,"Daily recurring events can be predicted by animals based on their internal circadian timing system. However, independently from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the central pacemaker of the circadian system in mammals, restriction of food access to a particular time of day elicits food anticipatory activity (FAA). This suggests an involvement of other central and/or peripheral clocks as well as metabolic signals in this behavior. One of the metabolic signals that is important for FAA under combined caloric and temporal food restriction is beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB). Here we show that the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (Mct1), which transports ketone bodies such as betaOHB across membranes of various cell types, is involved in FAA. In particular, we show that lack of the Mct1 gene in the liver, but not in neuronal or glial cells, reduces FAA in mice. This is associated with a reduction of betaOHB levels in the blood. Our observations suggest an important role of ketone bodies and its transporter Mct1 in FAA under caloric and temporal food restriction.",0,experimental mouse model; M. ulcerans in vitro,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"bacterial growth inhibition, down","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",skin,Skin/Integument,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Buruli ulcer,Infectious,"ulceration, down; wound healing, up","Gastric ulcer index, down; Wound healing, up",produced during ketogenic diet,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

Buruli ulcer (Mycobacterium ulcerans infection) is a chronic infectious disease characterized by large skin ulcerations caused by mycolactone, the major virulence factor of the bacillus. In the current study, we investigated the impact of ketogenic diet on this cutaneous disease in an experimental mouse model. This diet prevented ulceration, by modulating bacterial growth and host inflammatory response. beta-hydroxybutyrate, the major ketone body produced during ketogenic diet and diffusing in tissues, impeded M. ulcerans growth and mycolactone production in vitro underlying its potential key role in infection.

Whether combining the 2 can additively attenuate disease-induced muscle loss is unknown. OBJECTIVE: Based on previous observations of anticatabolic effects of protein and ketone bodies during inflammation, and using a novel model combining ongoing systemic inflammation, fasting, and immobilization, we tested whether the anticatabolic muscle response to oral amino acids is altered compared with control conditions, as well as whether coadministration of oral BHB and BLG further improves the muscle anabolic response. Muscle net balance (NBphe) was the primary outcome and intramyocellular signals were assessed. METHODS: In a randomized crossover design, 8 young men underwent either preconditioning with LPS (prestudy day: 1 ng/kg, study day: 0.5 ng/kg) combined with a 36-h fast and bed rest to mimic catabolic inflammatory disease (CAT) or an overnight fast (control [CTR]) prior to isocaloric nutritional interventions on 3 occasions separated by approximately 6 wk (range 42 to 83 d). RESULTS: NBphe increased similarly upon all conditions (interaction P = 0.65). From comparable baseline rates, both Rdphe [muscle synthesis, median ratio (95% CI): 0.44 (0.23, 0.86) P = 0.017] and Raphe [muscle breakdown, median ratio (95% CI): 0.46 (0.27, 0.78) P = 0.005] decreased following BHB + BLG compared with BLG. BLG increased Rdphe more under CAT conditions compared with CTR (interaction P = 0.02). CAT increased inflammation, energy expenditure, and lipid oxidation and decreased Rdphe and anabolic signaling [mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EPB1) phosphorylation]. CONCLUSION: In contrast to our initial hypothesis, NBphe increased similarly following BLG during CAT and CTR conditions; CAT however, specifically stimulated the BLG-mediated increase in protein synthesis, whereas BHB coadministration did not affect NBphe, but distinctly dampened the BLG-induced increase in muscle amino acid fluxes thereby liberating circulating amino acids for anabolic actions elsewhere.",BDH1,hepatocyte-specific BDH1-deficient mice; littermate controls,animal,Animal – Mouse; NS,"BDH1-mediated ketone body interconversion, down",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,hepatocytes,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"glycemic recovery after acute insulin challenge, down; susceptibility to starvation-induced hypoglycemia, no-change","Glycemic control, down; Blood glucose, no-change",exogenously administered AcAc,NS,D-BHB

However, the regulatory roles of ketogenesis and ketone metabolism on liver homeostasis remain unclear. Therefore, we sought to develop a better understanding of the metabolic consequences of hepatic ketone body metabolism by focusing on the redox-dependent interconversion of acetoacetate (AcAc) and D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-betaOHB). METHODS: Using targeted and isotope tracing high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, dual stable isotope tracer nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolic flux modeling, and complementary physiological approaches in novel cell type-specific knockout mice, we quantified the roles of hepatocyte D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1), a mitochondrial enzyme required for NAD(+)/NADH-dependent oxidation/reduction of ketone bodies. RESULTS: Exogenously administered AcAc is reduced to D-betaOHB, which increases hepatic NAD(+)/NADH ratio and reflects hepatic BDH1 activity. Livers of hepatocyte-specific BDH1-deficient mice did not produce D-betaOHB, but owing to extrahepatic BDH1, these mice nonetheless remained capable of AcAc/D-betaOHB interconversion. Compared to littermate controls, hepatocyte-specific BDH1 deficient mice exhibited diminished liver tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux and impaired gluconeogenesis, but normal hepatic energy charge overall. Glycemic recovery after acute insulin challenge was impaired in knockout mice, but they were not more susceptible to starvation-induced hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Ketone bodies influence liver homeostasis. While liver BDH1 is not required for whole body equilibration of AcAc and D-betaOHB, loss of the ability to interconvert these ketone bodies in hepatocytes results in impaired TCA cycle flux and glucose production. Therefore, through oxidation/reduction of ketone bodies, BDH1 is a significant contributor to hepatic mitochondrial redox, liver physiology, and organism-wide ketone body homeostasis.",0,male Sprague-Dawley rat,animal,Animal – Rat,"ketosis, up",Metabolic Regulation,central nervous system,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Central nervous system oxygen toxicity,Toxicology / Poisoning,"latency to seizure (LSz), up; seizure occurrence, down","Seizure activity, up; Seizure activity, down",exogenous ketone ester (KE) oral gavage 7.5 g/kg,Multi-source,NS

What limits the use of HBO(2) is the risk of developing central nervous system (CNS) oxygen toxicity (CNS-OT). A promising therapy for delaying CNS-OT is ketone metabolic therapy either through diet or exogenous ketone ester (KE) supplement. Previous studies indicate that KE induces ketosis and delays the onset of CNS-OT; however, the effects of exogeneous KE on cognition and performance are understudied. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that oral gavage with 7.5 g/kg induces ketosis and increases the latency time to seizure (LSz) without impairing cognition and performance. A single oral dose of 7.5 g/kg KE increases systemic beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels within 0.5 h and remains elevated for 4 h. Male rats were separated into three groups: control (no gavage), water-gavage, or KE-gavage, and were subjected to behavioral testing while breathing 1 ATA (101.3 kPa) of air. Testing included the following: DigiGait (DG), light/dark (LD), open field (OF), and novel object recognition (NOR). There were no adverse effects of KE on gait or motor performance (DG), cognition (NOR), and anxiety (LD, OF). In fact, KE had an anxiolytic effect (OF, LD). The LSz during exposure to 5 ATA (506.6 kPa) O(2) (</=90 min) increased 307% in KE-treated rats compared with control rats. In addition, KE prevented seizures in some animals. We conclude that 7.5 g/kg is an optimal dose of KE in the male Sprague-Dawley rat model of CNS-OT.",0; GLB1; CDKN2A; CDKN1A; SYNPO; NFE2L2; GSK3B,podocytes; streptozotocin-elicited murine DKD,animal; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells; Animal – Mouse,"GSK3beta inhibition, down","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",kidney,Kidney,podocytes,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Podocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetic kidney disease,Renal & Urological,"albuminuria, down; diabetic glomerulopathy, down; podocyte senescence, down","Albuminuria, down; Kidney function, down; Cell survival, down",NS,NS,NS
34277987,The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate mitigates the senescence response of glomerular podocytes to diabetic insults.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the most common complications of diabetes and is clinically featured by progressive albuminuria, consequent to glomerular destruction that involves podocyte senescence. Burgeoning evidence suggests that ketosis, in particular beta-hydroxybutyrate, exerts a beneficial effect on aging and on myriad metabolic or chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes and chronic kidney diseases. Its effect on DKD is largely unknown. In vitro in podocytes exposed to a diabetic milieu, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment substantially mitigated cellular senescence and injury, as evidenced by reduced formation of gammaH2AX foci, reduced staining for senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase activity, diminished expression of key mediators of senescence signaling like p16(INK4A) and p21, and preserved expression of synaptopodin. This beneficial action of beta-hydroxybutyrate coincided with a reinforced transcription factor Nrf2 antioxidant response. Mechanistically, beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), a convergent point for myriad signaling pathways regulating Nrf2 activity, seems to contribute. Indeed, trigonelline, a selective inhibitor of Nrf2, or ectopic expression of constitutively active mutant GSK3beta abolished, whereas selective activation of Nrf2 was sufficient for the anti-senescent and podocyte protective effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Moreover, molecular modeling and docking analysis revealed that beta-hydroxybutyrate is able to directly target the ATP-binding pocket of GSK3beta and thereby block its kinase activity. In murine models of streptozotocin-elicited DKD, beta-hydroxybutyrate therapy inhibited GSK3beta and reinforced Nrf2 activation in glomerular podocytes, resulting in lessened podocyte senescence and injury and improved diabetic glomerulopathy and albuminuria. Thus, our findings may pave the way for developing a beta-hydroxybutyrate-based novel approach of therapeutic ketosis for treating DKD.",0,patients with insulin-independent type 2 diabetes,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,serum,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Type 2 diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"fructosamine decreased, nan; HbA1c decreased, nan; mean daily glucose decreased, nan; time in range increased, nan","Fructosamine, nan; HbA1c, nan; Blood glucose, nan; Glycemic control, nan",exogenous ketone monoester (KE),Ketone ester (KE),NS

This study investigated the safety, tolerability, and effects on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes of an exogenous ketone monoester (KE) capable of inducing fasting-like elevations in serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) without the need for caloric or carbohydrate restriction. METHODS: Twenty one participants (14 men and 7 women, aged 45 +/- 11 years) with insulin-independent type 2 diabetes, and unchanged hypoglycaemic medication for the previous 6 months, were recruited for this non-randomised interventional study. Participants wore intermittent scanning glucose monitors (IS-GM) for a total of 6 weeks and were given 25 ml of KE 3 times daily for 4 weeks. Serum electrolytes, acid-base status, and betaHB concentrations were measured weekly and cardiovascular risk markers were measured before and after the intervention. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, with the secondary endpoint being glycaemic control. RESULTS: The 21 participants consumed a total of 1,588 drinks (39.7 litres) of KE over the course of the intervention. Adverse reactions were mild and infrequent, including mild nausea, headache, and gastric discomfort following fewer than 0.5% of the drinks. Serum electrolyte concentrations, acid-base status, and renal function remained normal throughout the study. Compared to baseline, exogenous ketosis induced a significant decrease in all glycaemic control markers, including fructosamine (335 +/- 60 mumol/L to 290 +/- 49 mumol/L, p < .01), HbA1c (61 +/- 10 mmol/mol to 55 +/- 9 mmol/mol [7.7 +/- 0.9% to 7.2 +/- 0.9%], p < .01), mean daily glucose (7.8 +/- 1.4 mM to 7.4 +/- 1.3 mM [140 +/- 23 mg/dl to 133 +/- 25 mg/dl], p < .01) and time in range (67 +/- 11% to 69 +/- 10%, p < .01).

However, the mechanism underlying beige adipocyte formation is largely unknown. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is highly induced in WAT and has been implicated in lipid metabolism. Here, we show that ApoE deficiency in mice increased oxygen consumption and thermogenesis and enhanced adipose browning pattern in inguinal WAT (iWAT), with associated characteristics such as increased Ucp1 and Ppargamma expression. At the cellular level, ApoE deficient beige adipocytes had increased glucose uptake and higher mitochondrial respiration than wild-type cells. Mechanistically, we showed that ApoE deficient iWAT and primary adipose precursor cells activated the thermogenic genes program by stimulating the production of ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), a novel adipose browning promoting factor. This was accompanied by increased expression of genes involved in ketogenesis and could be compromised by the treatment for ketogenesis inhibitors. Consistently, ApoE deficient mice show higher serum betaHB level than wild-type mice in the fed state and during cold exposure. Our results further demonstrate that the increased betaHB production in ApoE deficient adipose precursor cells could be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced Cd36 expression and CD36-mediated fatty acid utilization. Our findings uncover a previously uncharacterized role for ApoE in energy homeostasis via its cell-autonomous action in WAT.",NFE2L2,db/db mice; HK-2 cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"NRF2 nuclear translocation, up",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,kidney,Kidney,renal tubular epithelial cell (HK-2),Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,nucleus,Nucleus & Chromatin,Nucleoplasm,Diabetic kidney disease,Renal & Urological,"disease progression, down","Disease progression, down",beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dapagliflozin (1 mg/kg), glimepiride (2.5 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered daily via oral gavage for 8 weeks in db/db mice. Expression levels of ageing marker genes (p21, p16, and p53) and oxidative stress were measured in the kidney using real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. For in vitro analysis, HK-2 cells, a human renal tubular epithelial cell line, were pretreated with H(2) O(2) to induce cellular senescence, and the levels of ageing markers were measured after treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) or NRF2-specific siRNA. RESULTS: Expression levels of ageing marker genes (p21, p16 and p53) and senescence-associated secretory phenotypes of the kidney were increased in the vehicle-treated db/db (db/db + vehicle) group compared with the db/+ group, and this increase was markedly reversed in the dapagliflozin-treated db/db (db/db + SGLT2 inhibitor) group, but not in the glimepiride-treated db/db (db/db + sulphonylurea [SU]) group. In the kidneys of mice in the db/db + SGLT2 inhibitor group, oxidative stress and DNA damage were also reduced compared with those of mice in the db/db + vehicle and db/db + SU groups. Dapagliflozin increased plasma beta-HB, which reduced H(2) O(2) -induced DNA damage and senescence in HK-2 cells. beta-HB-induced NRF2 nuclear translocation mediated anti-senescent effects by inducing antioxidant pathways.

The emerging diversity of the lysine acylation landscape prompted us to investigate the full proteomic impact of Kbhb. Global protein Kbhb is induced in a tissue-specific manner by a variety of interventions that evoke beta-OHB. Mass spectrometry analysis of the beta-hydroxybutyrylome in mouse liver revealed 891 sites of Kbhb within 267 proteins enriched for fatty acid, amino acid, detoxification, and one-carbon metabolic pathways. Kbhb inhibits S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (AHCY), a rate-limiting enzyme of the methionine cycle, in parallel with altered metabolite levels.

The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for regulating the Trx1 level and/or activity during diabetic cardiomyopathy is unknown. beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), a major ketone body in mammals, acts as an alternative energy source in cardiomyocytes under stress, but it also appears to be involved in additional mechanisms that protect the heart against stress. betaHB upregulated Trx1 in primary cultured cardiomyocytes in a dose- and a time-dependent manner and a ketogenic diet upregulated Trx1 in the heart. betaHB protected cardiomyocytes against H(2)O(2)-induced death, an effect that was abolished in the presence of Trx1 knockdown. betaHB also alleviated the H(2)O(2)-induced inhibition of mTOR and AMPK, known targets of Trx1, in a Trx1-dependent manner, suggesting that betaHB potentiates Trx1 function. It has been shown that betaHB is a natural inhibitor of HDAC1 and knockdown of HDAC1 upregulated Trx1 in cardiomyocytes, suggesting that betaHB may upregulate Trx1 through HDAC inhibition. betaHB induced Trx1 acetylation and inhibited Trx1 degradation, suggesting that betaHB-induced inhibition of HDAC1 may stabilize Trx1 through protein acetylation. These results suggest that betaHB potentiates the antioxidant defense in cardiomyocytes through the inhibition of HDAC1 and the increased acetylation and consequent stabilization of Trx1. Thus, modest upregulation of ketone bodies in diabetic hearts may protect the heart through the upregulation of Trx1.",0,64 individuals with obesity,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Obesity,Metabolic & Endocrine,"metabolic adaptation at resting metabolic rate (RMR), up (females); metabolic adaptation at resting metabolic rate (RMR), no-change (males)","Energy expenditure, up (females); Energy expenditure, no-change (males)",very-low energy diet (VLED),Fasting / Caloric restriction (endogenous),NS
34407998,Association between ketosis and metabolic adaptation at the level of resting metabolic rate.,"BACKGROUND: The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) has been shown to act as a signaling molecule that regulates metabolism and energy homeostasis during starvation in animal models. A potential association between betaHB and metabolic adaptation (a reduction in energy expenditure below predicted levels) in humans has never been explored. OBJECTIVE: To determine if metabolic adaptation at the level of resting metabolic rate (RMR) was associated with the magnitude of ketosis induced by a very-low energy diet (VLED). A secondary aim was to investigate if the association was modulated by sex. METHODS: Sixty-four individuals with obesity (BMI: 34.5 +/- 3.4 kg/m(2); age: 45.7 +/- 8.0 years; 31 males) enrolled in a 1000 kcal/day diet for 8 weeks. Body weight/composition, RMR and betaHB (as a measure of ketosis) were determined at baseline and week 9 (W9). Metabolic adaptation was defined as a significantly lower measured versus predicted RMR (from own regression model). RESULTS: Participants lost on average 14.0 +/- 3.9 kg and were ketotic (betaHB: 0.76 +/- 0.51 mM) at W9. A significant metabolic adaptation was seen (-84 +/- 106 kcal/day, P < 0.001), with no significant differences between sexes. [betaHB] was positively correlated with the magnitude of metabolic adaptation in females (r = 0.432, P = 0.012, n = 33), but not in males (r = 0.089, P = 0.634, n = 31). CONCLUSION: In females with obesity, but not males, the larger the [betaHB] under VLED, the greater the metabolic adaptation at the level of RMR. More studies are needed to confirm these findings and to explore the mechanisms behind the sex difference in the association between ketosis and metabolic adaptation.

Recent studies suggest that beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), a fasting-characteristic ketone body, potentially acts as a signaling molecule mediating its beneficial effects via histone deacetylase inhibition. Here, we have investigated whether betaOHB, in comparison to the well-established histone deacetylase inhibitor butyrate, influences cellular differentiation and gene expression. In various cell lines and primary cell types, millimolar concentrations of betaOHB did not alter differentiation in vitro, as determined by gene expression and histological assessment, whereas equimolar concentrations of butyrate consistently impaired differentiation. RNA sequencing revealed that unlike butyrate, betaOHB minimally impacted gene expression in primary adipocytes, macrophages, and hepatocytes. However, in myocytes, betaOHB up-regulated genes involved in the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, while down-regulating genes belonging to cytokine and chemokine signal transduction. Overall, our data do not support the notion that betaOHB serves as a powerful signaling molecule regulating gene expression but suggest that betaOHB may act as a niche signaling molecule in myocytes.",0,anesthetized nondiabetic male Sprague-Dawley rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"BHB availability, down",Metabolic Regulation,adrenal gland,Adrenal gland,glucose-responsive C1 neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"sympathoadrenal response initiation threshold, down","Sympathoadrenal response threshold, down",ketogenic diet (KD),Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

Ketogenic diets (KD) are an increasingly popular diabetes management tool; however, the effects of KD on the sympathoadrenal response are largely unknown. Here, we determined the effects of KD-induced ketosis on the sympathoadrenal response to a single insulin-induced hypoglycemic challenge. We investigated how a 3 week KD feeding regimen affected the main components of the sympathoadrenal counterregulatory response: adrenal sympathetic nerve activity (ASNA), adrenal gland activity, plasma epinephrine, and brainstem glucose-responsive C1 neuronal activation in anesthetized, nondiabetic male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats on KD had similar blood glucose (BG) levels and elevated ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels compared to the control Chow diet group. All KD rats responded to hypoglycemia with a robust increase in ASNA, which was initiated at significantly lower BG levels compared to Chow-fed rats. The delay in hypoglycemia-induced ASNA increase was concurrent with rapid disappearance of BHB from cerebral and peripheral circulation. Adrenal gland activity paralleled epinephrine and ASNA response. Overall, KD-induced ketosis was associated with initiation of the sympathoadrenal response at lower blood glucose levels; however, the magnitude of the response was not diminished.",MPO; 0,mice; DSS-induced colitis; engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcNL4); wild-type EcN,animal,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line; Animal – Other Mammal,"elevated gut 3HB levels, up",Metabolic Regulation,colon,Large intestine/Colon,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Colitis,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"colitis severity, down","Colitis severity, down",synthesized in gut lumen by engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcNL4),NS,NS

Probiotic bacteria could be an effective treatment. The probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) was engineered to synthesize the ketone body (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) for sustainable production in the gut lumen of mice suffering from colitis. Components of heterologous 3HB synthesis routes were constructed, expressed, optimized, and inserted into the EcN genome, combined with deletions in competitive branch pathways. The genome-engineered EcN produced the highest 3HB level of 0.6 g/L under microaerobic conditions. The live therapeutic was found to colonize the mouse gastrointestinal tract over 14 days, elevating gut 3HB and short-chain-length fatty acid (SCFA) levels 8.7- and 3.1-fold compared to those of wild-type EcN, respectively. The sustainable presence of 3HB in mouse guts promoted the growth of probiotic bacteria, especially Akkermansia spp., to over 31% from the initial 2% of all the microbiome. As a result, the engineered EcN termed EcNL4 ameliorated colitis induced via dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. Compared to wild-type EcN or oral administration of 3HB, oral EcNL4 uptake demonstrated better effects on mouse weights, colon lengths, occult blood levels, gut tissue myeloperoxidase activity and proinflammatory cytokine concentrations. Thus, a promising live bacterium was developed to improve colonic microenvironments and further treat colitis.

Since the majority of obese subjects are leptin resistant, leptin sensitizers, rather than leptin itself, are expected to be anti-obesity drugs. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the hypothalamus plays a key role in the pathogenesis of leptin resistance. ATP-deficient cells are vulnerable to ER stress and ATP treatment protects cells against ER stress. Thus, we investigated the therapeutic effects of oral 1,3-butanediol (BD) administration, which increases plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and hypothalamic ATP concentrations, in diet induced obese (DIO) mice with leptin resistance. BD treatment effectively decreased food intake and body weight in DIO mice. In contrast, BD treatment had no effect in leptin deficient ob/ob mice. Co-administration experiment demonstrated that BD treatment sensitizes leptin action in both DIO and ob/ob mice. We also demonstrated that BD treatment attenuates ER stress and leptin resistance at the hypothalamus level. This is the first report to confirm the leptin sensitizing effect of BD treatment in leptin resistant DIO mice. The present study provides collateral evidence suggesting that the effect of BD treatment is mediated by the elevation of hypothalamic ATP concentration.

The primary aim here was to investigate whether ketosis (i.e., raised BHB levels), induced by a ketogenic supplement, influences serum levels of mature BDNF (mBDNF) and its precursor proBDNF in healthy older adults. A secondary aim was to determine the intra-individual stability (repeatability) of those biomarkers, measured as intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Method: Three of the arms in a 6-arm randomized cross-over trial were used for the current sub-study. Fifteen healthy volunteers, 65-75 y, 53% women, were tested once a week. Test oils, mixed in coffee and cream, were ingested after a 12-h fast. Labeled by their level of ketosis, the arms provided: sunflower oil (lowK); coconut oil (midK); caprylic acid + coconut oil (highK). Repeated blood samples were collected for 4 h after ingestion. Serum BDNF levels were analyzed for changes from baseline to 1, 2 and 4 h to compare the arms. Individual associations between BHB and BDNF were analyzed cross-sectionally and for a delayed response (changes in BHB 0-2 h to changes in BDNF at 0-4 h). ICC estimates were calculated from baseline levels from the three study days. Results: proBDNF increased more in highK vs. lowK between 0 and 4 h (z-score: beta = 0.25, 95% CI 0.07-0.44; p = 0.007). Individual change in BHB 0-2 h, predicted change in proBDNF 0-4 h, (beta = 0.40, CI 0.12-0.67; p = 0.006). Change in mBDNF was lower in highK vs. lowK at 0-2 h (beta = -0.88, CI -1.37 to -0.40; p < 0.001) and cumulatively 0-4 h (beta = -1.01, CI -1.75 to -0.27; p = 0.01), but this could not be predicted by BHB levels. ICC was 0.96 (95% CI 0.92-0.99) for proBDNF, and 0.72 (CI 0.47-0.89) for mBDNF. Conclusions: The findings support a link between changes in peripheral BHB and proBDNF in healthy older adults. For mBDNF, changes differed between arms but independent to BHB levels. Replication is warranted due to the small sample. Excellent repeatability encourages future investigations on proBDNF as a predictor of brain health.

We hypothesised that acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) accumulation and altered redox status during low-flow ischaemia would support ketone body production in the heart. Combining a Langendorff heart model of low-flow ischaemia/reperfusion with liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we show that beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) accumulated in the ischaemic heart to 23.9 nmol/gww and was secreted into the coronary effluent. Sodium oxamate, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) inhibitor, increased ischaemic beta-OHB levels 5.3-fold and slowed contractile recovery. Inhibition of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase (HMGCS2) with hymeglusin lowered ischaemic beta-OHB accumulation by 40%, despite increased flux through succinyl-CoA-3-oxaloacid CoA transferase (SCOT), resulting in greater contractile recovery. Hymeglusin also protected cardiac mitochondrial respiratory capacity during ischaemia/reperfusion. In conclusion, net ketone generation occurs in the heart under conditions of low-flow ischaemia. The process is driven by flux through both HMGCS2 and SCOT, and impacts on cardiac functional recovery from ischaemia/reperfusion.",0,160 subjects with or without metabolic abnormalities; arterial ring calcification model; high phosphate-induced VSMC calcification model,human; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice; In vitro – Primary cells,"autophagy enhancement, up",Cell Death & Survival,artery,Vasculature,vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs),Muscle – Smooth / Perivascular,Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Vascular calcification,Cardiovascular,"vascular calcification severity, down","Vascular calcification severity, down",beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) induced by calorie restriction; serum BHB level,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid); NS,NS

However, the effect of BHB on VC and the potential mechanism remain unknown. Methods: A total of 160 subjects with or without metabolic abnormalities (MAs) were assigned to four groups according to different calcification severities. The association between BHB, MAs, and VC was investigated via mediation analysis. Then, with high phosphate-induced calcification models, the effect of BHB on arterial ring calcification and osteogenic phenotypic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) was investigated. Hereafter the expressions of autophagy biomarkers, autophagy flux, and effects of autophagy inhibitors on VC were detected. Results: Severe VC was observed in the elderly, accompanied with a higher proportion of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. The serum BHB level was an independent influencing factor of VC severities. With mediation analysis, BHB was determined as a significant mediator in the effects of MAs on VC, and the indirect effect of BHB accounted for 23% of the total effect. Furthermore, BHB directly inhibited arterial ring calcification and osteogenic phenotypic differentiation in VSMCs, accompanied with autophagy enhancement in VSMCs. In accordance, the inhibition of autophagy counteracted the protective effect of BHB on VC. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that BHB mediated the effects of MAs on VC; then, it further elucidated that BHB could inhibit arterial and VSMC calcification via autophagy enhancement.",CASP1; PYCARD; NLRP3; TNF; NFKB1; 0; IL18; IL1B,male rats; cerulein-induced AP,animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Mouse,"NLRP3 inflammasome suppression, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,pancreas,Pancreas,acinar cells,Epithelial – Glandular & Breast,Mammary epithelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Pancreatitis,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"pathological changes, down","Pathology, down",200 mg/kg BHB i.p.; 2 doses of 200 mg/kg BHB i.p.,Intraperitoneal BHB,NS

The purpose of this study was to examine the possible therapeutic effects of BHB in the experimentally-induced AP model in rats. METHODS: In our study, male rats were randomly allotted into 6 groups, as control (0.9% saline i.p.), BHB1 (200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), BHB2 (2 doses of 200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), AP (4 doses of 50 mug/kg cerulein i.p., 4 doses at 1 h intervals), AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In pancreatic tissue sections, immunohistochemistry staining and western blot analysis for the inflammasome complex (caspase-1, ASC, and NLRP3) and inflammation-associated proteins (TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB) and a histopathological examination were performed. The levels of lipase, amylase, interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1beta in serum were measured. RESULTS: Several pathological degenerations, including edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, acinus necrosis, and bleeding were observed in the AP group, while the histological architecture of the control and the sham BHB1 and BHB2 groups were regular. The AP-induced pathological changes were considerably alleviated in the AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In the AP group, a conspicuous increase in caspase-1, ASC, NLRP3, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB proteins, and in the levels of amylase, lipase, IL-18, and IL-1beta were detected. BHB treatments after AP induction decreased those proteins to the level of control. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that BHB has the potential to cure AP by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome and can be used in the treatment of many diseases which progress through the NLRP3 inflammasome.",0; NPHS1; WT1; GSK3B,adriamycin-injured murine glomerular podocytes; experimental kidney disease models,animal,Animal – Mouse; NS,"deacetylation, down",Epigenetic Regulation,kidney,Kidney,glomerular podocytes,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Podocytes,actin cytoskeleton,Cytoskeleton,Actin cytoskeleton,Adriamycin-induced glomerular epithelial cell injury,Renal & Urological,"glomerular epithelial cell injury, down","Kidney function, down",NS,NS,NS
34541914,The protective effect of beta-hydroxybutyric acid on renal glomerular epithelial cells in adriamycin-induced injury.,"Beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) exerts a protective effect in experimental of kidney disease models. However, the mechanisms underlying this activity are not well defined. BHB stands out for its ability to inhibit the Nepsilon-lysine acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins, which may affect cellular processes and protein functions. In adriamycin-injured murine glomerular podocytes, BHB ameliorates podocyte damage and preserves actin cytoskeleton integrity, reminiscent of the effect of MS275, a highly selective inhibitor of lysine deacetylase. Further research found that adriamycin causes the reduced acetylation of nephrin, WT-1, and GSK3beta. This process is abrogated by the lysine deacetylase inhibitor or BHB, suggesting that the acetylation of these molecules regulates their activity. In contrast, anacardic acid, a selective inhibitor of acetyltransferase, decreases the acetylation of nephrin, WT-1, and GSK3beta and mitigates the podocyte protective effects of BHB. Taken together, BHB attenuates adriamycin-elicited glomerular epithelial cell injury, at least in part, by inhibiting the deacetylation of the key molecules implicated in glomerular injury.",0,episodic migraine patients (n=41),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Migraine without aura,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"migraine frequency, no-change; migraine intensity, no-change","Migraine frequency, no-change; Pain sensitivity, no-change",exogenous DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic

Previously, studies demonstrated that ketogenic diet causes a substantial reduction in migraine frequency. Since the ketogenic diet is restricting and its adherence is difficult, we proposed to supplement ketone bodies exogenously to provide a prophylactic effect in migraineurs. AIM: To evaluate the prophylactic effect of exogenous DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation in episodic migraineurs. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised crossover trial was conducted, involving 41 patients with episodic migraine. Patients were randomised 1:1 into placebo or beta-hydroxybutyrate group before entering the first treatment period. Each treatment period was 12 weeks long, followed by four weeks of washout phase and four weeks of run-in phase before entering into the corresponding second treatment period. The primary endpoint was the number of migraine days in the last four weeks of treatment, adjusted for baseline. RESULTS: We observed no clinically significant amelioration of migraine frequency or intensity under DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment as compared to placebo regarding number of migraine days (mean difference [95% CI]: -1.1[-5.07, 2.85]), migraine intensity (0-10 VAS: 1.5[-0.8, 3.7]).

34557014,Sodium Butyrate Protects Against Ethanol-Induced Toxicity in SH-SY5Y Cell Line.,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD), brought about by excessive alcohol use, is associated with damages to several organs including the brain. Chronic excessive use of alcohol can compromise intestinal integrity, leading to changes in gut microbiota (GM) composition known as dysbiosis. Dysbiosis, by disruption of the gut-brain axis (GBA), further exacerbates the deleterious effects of alcohol. One of the fermentation by-products of GM is butyrate (BUT), a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) that plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the GBA. Alcohol metabolism results in formation of acetaldehyde, a highly reactive compound that reacts with dopamine in the brain to form toxic adducts such as salsolinol. Recent studies indicate potential neuro-protective effects of BUT against various toxicants including salsolinol. Here, we sought to investigate whether BUT can also protect against alcohol toxicity. Pretreatment of neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cells with 500 mM ethanol (ETOH) for 24 h resulted in approximately 40% reduction in cell viability, which was totally blocked by 10 microM of either BUT or AR 420,626 (AR), a selective fatty acid 3 receptor (FA3R) agonist. The neuro-protective effects of both BUT and AR were significantly (80%) attenuated by beta-hydroxy butyrate (BHB), a selective FA3R antagonist. Interestingly, combination of BUT and AR resulted in synergistic protection against ETOH, which was totally blocked by BHB. These findings suggest potential utility of butyrate and/or FA3R agonists against ETOH-induced toxicity.",CYBB; GSK3B,high-fat diet (HFD); N(omega)-nitrol-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) two-hit HFpEF model,animal,NS; Animal – Other Mammal,"NOX2/GSK-3beta pathway, down",Multiple mechanisms,myocardium,Heart,CD3+CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells,Hematopoietic / Immune,T cells,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction,Cardiovascular,"diastolic function up, nan; fibrosis down, nan; cardiac remodeling down, nan","Diastolic function, nan; Fibrosis, nan; Cardiac remodeling, nan",weekly intraperitoneal injection of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

METHODS: A two-hit model with a high-fat diet (HFD) and N(omega)-nitrol-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was used as an HFpEF model. The treatment group received a weekly intraperitoneal injection of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Cardiac function, inflammation, and fibrosis were evaluated.

The NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)/glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) pathway was examined by immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: BHB improved diastolic function, fibrosis and cardiac remodeling in HFpEF. Additionally, BHB inhibited cardiac inflammation and increased cardiac Treg cells, which could be due to the downregulation of the NOX2/GSK-3beta pathway.

However, existing therapeutics for type 2 diabetes mellitus have limited success on the prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The aim of this study was to determine whether moderate elevation in D-beta-hydroxybutyrate improves cardiac function in animals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results Type 2 diabetic (db/db) and their corresponding wild-type mice were fed a control diet or a diet where carbohydrates were equicalorically replaced by D-beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol monoester (ketone ester [KE]). After 4 weeks, echocardiography demonstrated that a KE diet improved systolic and diastolic function in db/db mice. A KE diet increased expression of mitochondrial succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid-CoA transferase and restored decreased expression of mitochondrial beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, key enzymes in cardiac ketone metabolism. A KE diet significantly enhanced both basal and ADP-mediated oxygen consumption in cardiac mitochondria from both wild-type and db/db animals; however, it did not result in the increased mitochondrial respiratory control ratio. Additionally, db/db mice on a KE diet had increased resistance to oxidative and redox stress, with evidence of restoration of decreased expression of thioredoxin and glutathione peroxidase 4 and less permeability transition pore activity in mitochondria. Mitochondrial biogenesis, quality control, and elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy were significantly increased in cardiomyocytes from db/db mice on a KE diet. The increase in mitophagy was correlated with restoration of mitofusin 2 expression, which contributed to improved coupling between cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase translocation into mitochondria and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-mediated autophagosome formation. Conclusions Moderate elevation in circulating D-beta-hydroxybutyrate levels via KE supplementation enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, quality control, and oxygen consumption and increases resistance to oxidative/redox stress and mPTP opening, thus resulting in improvement of cardiac function in animals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",BDNF,adults with obesity (n=14),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"cerebral blood flow, up",Vascular Function & Angiogenesis,extracranial arteries,Vasculature,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Cognitive dysfunction,General Signs & Symptoms,"cognition, up","Cognition, up","ketone supplements containing beta-hydroxybutyrate, 30 mL (12 g) thrice-daily for 14 days",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Ketone supplements containing beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) are a purported therapeutic strategy for improving brain health in at-risk populations. We tested the hypothesis that short-term beta-OHB supplementation will elevate cerebral blood flow and BDNF, as well as improve cognition in adults with obesity. In a placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over design, 14 adults with obesity (10 females; aged 56 +/- 12 years; body mass index = 33.8 +/- 6.9 kg m(-2) ) consumed 30 mL (12 g) of beta-OHB or placebo thrice-daily for 14 days. Blood flow (Q) and cerebrovascular conductance (CVC) were measured in the common carotid (CCA), internal carotid (ICA) and vertebral (VA) arteries by duplex ultrasound. BDNF was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cognition was assessed by the digit-symbol substitution (DSST), Stroop and task-switching tests. Following 14 days of ketone supplementation, we observed significant improvements in cerebrovascular outcomes including Q(CCA) (+12%), Q(VA) (+11%), VA(CVC) (+12%) and VA shear rate (+10%). DSST performance significantly improved following ketone supplementation (+2.7 correct responses) and improved DSST performance was positively associated improvements in cerebrovascular outcomes including Q(CCA) , CCA(CVC) , Q(VA) and VA(CVC) . By contrast to one hypothesis, beta-OHB did not impact fasting serum and plasma BDNF. beta-OHB supplementation improved cognition in adults with obesity, which may be partly facilitated by improvements in cerebral blood flow. beta-OHB supplementation was well-tolerated and appears to be safe for cerebrovascular health, suggesting potential therapeutic benefits of beta-OHB in a population at risk of neurocognitive impairment. KEY POINTS: People with obesity are at increased risk of neurocognitive dysfunction, partly as a result of -induced reductions in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Ketone supplements containing beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) reduce postprandial hyperglycaemia, which may increase CBF and BDNF, thereby protecting against obesity-related cognitive dysfunction. We show for the first time that 14 days of thrice-daily beta-OHB supplementation improves aspects of cognition and increases cerebrovascular flow, conductance and shear rate in the extracranial arteries of adults with obesity. Our preliminary data indicate a significant positive relationship between elevated CBF and improved cognition following beta-OHB supplementation. This trial provides a foundation for the potential non-pharmacological therapeutic application of beta-OHB supplementation in patient groups at risk of hyperglycaemic cerebrovascular disease and cognitive dysfunction.",HAMP; 0,people with new-onset prediabetes after acute pancreatitis; 18 participants; randomised controlled cross-over trial,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Human – Interventional,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,plasma,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Pancreatitis,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"hepcidin levels, no-change; ferritin levels, no-change","Hepcidin levels, no-change; Ferritin, no-change",exogenous ketone monoester (beta-hydroxybutyrate),Multi-source,NS

Objective: The objective was to investigate the effect of acute exogenous ketone monoester (beta-hydroxybutyrate) on plasma levels of markers of iron metabolism in people with prediabetes. Methods: Eighteen participants with new-onset prediabetes after acute pancreatitis aged 18 years or above took part in randomised controlled cross-over trial in Auckland, New Zealand. After an overnight fast, participants consumed the exogenous ketone supplement or placebo. Blood samples were collected in the fasted state (0 minutes) and then serially every 30 minutes for 150 minutes. Both participants and study personnel were blinded to the intervention/placebo allocation. Repeated measures analysis of variance was performed using total area under the curve to determine the change in hepcidin and ferritin over time after consumption of the exogenous ketone supplement and placebo. Results: Consumption of the exogenous ketone supplement significantly elevated blood levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate from 0.20 mmol L(-1) at baseline to 3.50 mmol L(-1) at 30 minutes (p < 0.05) and remained significantly elevated for the duration of the trial. The total area under the curve of hepcidin was 340.5 +/- 121.1 ng mL(-1) after the exogenous ketone supplementation as compared with 343.2 +/- 119.6 ng mL(-1) min(-1) after the use of placebo (p = 0.91).

Exogenous supplementation of ketones also helps prevent heart failure (HF) development in rodent models, but whether ketones can be used to treat HF remains unexplored. Herein, we investigated whether chronic supplementation of ketones is beneficial for the heart in a mouse model of established HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: To elevate circulating ketone levels, we utilized (R)-3-hydroxybutyl-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate [ketone ester (KE)]. C57Bl/6N male mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery. After developing HF, mice were treated with either 20% KE or vehicle via drinking water for 2 weeks. In another cohort, mice 3-4 weeks post-TAC received acute intravenous infusions of BHB or saline for 1 h and their cardiac function was measured. 20% KE significantly elevated blood BHB in mice (P < 0.01) without inducing ketoacidosis or altering other metabolic parameters. Mice with overt HF (30-45% ejection fraction) treated with 20% KE displayed significantly elevated circulating ketone levels compared with vehicle-treated mice (P < 0.05). The significant cardiac dysfunction in mice with HF continued to worsen after 2 weeks of vehicle treatment, whereas this decline was absent in KE-treated mice (mean difference 4.7% ejection fraction; P < 0.01). KE treatment also alleviated TAC-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (P < 0.05) and reduced the TAC-induced elevated cardiac periostin (P < 0.05), a marker of activated fibroblasts. Cardiac fibrosis was also significantly reduced with KE treatment in TAC mice (P < 0.01). In another cohort, acute BHB infusion significantly increased the cardiac output of mice with HF (P < 0.05), providing further support that ketone therapy can be used to treat HF. CONCLUSIONS: We show that chronic treatment of exogenous ketones is of benefit to the failing heart and that chronic ketone elevation may be a therapeutic option for HF.

However, whether an increased ketone body supply in hypoxic cardiomyocytes and ischemic hearts is protective or not remains elusive. The goal of this study is to determine the effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), the main constituent of ketone bodies, on cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions and the effects of ketogenic diet (KD) on cardiac function in a myocardial infarction (MI) mouse model. METHODS: Human peripheral blood collected from patients with acute myocardial infarction and healthy volunteers was used to detect the level of beta-OHB. N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) were measured to study the relationship between plasma beta-OHB and cardiac function. Adult mouse cardiomyocytes and MI mouse models fed a KD were used to research the effect of beta-OHB on cardiac damage. qPCR, western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence were used to detect the interaction between beta-OHB and glycolysis. Live/dead cell staining and imaging, lactate dehydrogenase, Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, echocardiography, and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining were performed to evaluate the cardiomyocyte death, cardiac function, and infarct sizes. RESULTS: beta-OHB level was significantly higher in acute MI patients and MI mice. Treatment with beta-OHB exacerbated cardiomyocyte death and decreased glucose absorption and glycolysis under hypoxic conditions. These effects were partially ameliorated by inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) degradation via roxadustat administration in hypoxia-stimulated cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, beta-OHB metabolisms were obscured in cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, MI mice fed a KD exhibited exacerbated cardiac dysfunction compared with control chow diet (CD)-fed MI mice. CONCLUSION: Elevated beta-OHB levels may be maladaptive to the heart under hypoxic/ischemic conditions. Administration of roxadustat can partially reverse these harmful effects by stabilizing HIF-1alpha and inducing a metabolic shift toward glycolysis for energy production.",0,Drosophila melanogaster; mice fed a high-fat diet,animal,Animal – Invertebrate; Animal – Mouse,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"metabolic health, improved; memory, improved","Metabolic health, improved; Memory (general), improved",beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

34784103,Effect of empagliflozin on ketone bodies in patients with stable chronic heart failure.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicated that sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 inhibition increases levels of ketone bodies in the blood in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes. Other studies suggested that in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), increased myocardial oxygen demand can be provided by ketone bodies as a fuel substrate. Experimental studies reported that ketone bodies, specifically beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) may increase blood pressure (BP) by impairing endothelium-dependant relaxation, thereby leading to increased vascular stiffness. In our study we assessed whether the SGLT 2 inhibition with empagliflozin increases ketone bodies in patients with stable CHF and whether such an increase impairs BP and vascular function. METHODS: In a prospective, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group single centre study 75 patients with CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction 39.0 +/- 8.2%) were randomised (2:1) to the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin 10 mg orally once daily or to placebo, 72 patients completed the study. After a run-in phase we evaluated at baseline BP by 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring, vascular stiffness parameters by the SphygmoCor system (AtCor Medical, Sydney, NSW, Australia) and fasting metabolic parameters, including beta-OHB by an enzymatic assay (Beckman Coulter DxC 700 AU). The same measurements were repeated 12 weeks after treatment. In 19 of the 72 patients serum levels of beta-OHB were beneath the lower border of our assay (< 0.05 mmol/l) therefore being excluded from the subsequent analysis. RESULTS: In patients with stable CHF, treatment with empagliflozin (n = 36) was followed by an increase of beta-OHB by 33.39% (p = 0.017), reduction in 24 h systolic (p = 0.038) and diastolic (p = 0.085) ABP, weight loss (p = 0.003) and decrease of central systolic BP (p = 0.008) and central pulse pressure (p = 0.008). The increase in beta-OHB was related to an attenuated decrease of empagliflozin-induced 24 h systolic (r = 0.321, p = 0.069) and diastolic (r = 0.516, p = 0.002) ABP and less reduction of central systolic BP (r = 0.470, p = 0.009) and central pulse pressure (r = 0.391, p = 0.033). No significant changes were seen in any of these parameters after 12 weeks of treatment in the placebo group (n = 17). CONCLUSION: In patients with stable CHF ketone bodies as assessed by beta-OHB increased after treatment with empagliflozin. This increase led to an attenuation of the beneficial effects of empagliflozin on BP and vascular parameters.

The effectiveness of metabolic approaches to seizure control is being increasingly shown in a wide variety of epilepsies. This study investigates the efficacy of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in the betamethasone-NMDA model of rat IS. Prenatal rats were exposed to betamethasone on gestational day 15 (G15) and NMDA on postnatal day 15 (P15). Video-electroencephalography (v-EEG) was used to monitor spasms. NMDA consistently induced hyperflexion spasms associated with interictal sharp-slow wave EEG activity and ictal flattening of EEG signals, reminiscent of hypsarrhythmia and electrodecrement, respectively. 2-DG (500 mg/kg, i.p), BHB (200 mg/kg, i.p.), or both were administered immediately after occurrence of the first spasm. No experimental treatment altered significantly the number, severity, or progression of spasms compared with saline treatment. These data suggest that metabolic inhibition of glycolysis or ketogenesis does not reduce infantile spasms in the NMDA model. The study further validates the betamethasone-NMDA model in terms of its behavioral and electrographic resemblance to human IS and supports its use for preclinical drug screening.",0,healthy human volunteers (n=10),human,Human – Interventional,"L-alanine availability for gluconeogenesis, down",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"blood glucose, down","Blood glucose, down",25 g of d-beta-hydroxybutyrate in the form of a KE drink (DeltaG((R))),Multi-source,D-BHB

Additionally, the glucose-lowering effect of acute ketosis is greater in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). On the contrary, L-alanine is a gluconeogenic substrate secreted by skeletal muscle at higher levels in people with T2D and infusing of ketones lower circulating L-alanine blood levels. In this study, we sought to determine whether supplementation with L-alanine would attenuate the glucose-lowering effect of exogenous ketosis using a ketone ester (KE). METHODS: This crossover study involved 10 healthy human volunteers who fasted for 24 h prior to the ingestion of 25 g of d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) in the form of a KE drink (DeltaG((R)) ) on two separate visits. During one of the visits, participants additionally ingested 2 g of L-alanine to see whether L-alanine supplementation would attenuate the glucose-lowering effect of the KE drink. Blood L-alanine, L-glutamine, glucose, betaHB, free fatty acids (FFA), lactate and C-peptide were measured for 120 min after ingestion of the KE, with or without L-alanine. FINDINGS: The KE drinks elevated blood betaHB concentrations from negligible levels to 4.52 +/- 1.23 mmol/L, lowered glucose from 4.97 +/- SD 0.39 to 3.77 +/- SD 0.40 mmol/L, and lowered and L-alanine from 0.56 +/- SD 0.88 to 0.41 +/- SD 0.91 mmol/L. L-alanine in the KE drink elevated blood L-Alanine by 0.68 +/- SD 0.15 mmol/L, but had no significant effect on blood betaHB, L-glutamine, FFA, lactate, nor C-peptide concentrations. By contrast, L-alanine supplementation significantly attenuated the ketosis-induced drop in glucose from 28% +/- SD 8% to 16% +/- SD 7% (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The glucose-lowering effect of acutely elevated betaHB is partially due to betaHB decreasing L-alanine availability as a substrate for gluconeogenesis.",0,fasting healthy participants,human,Human – Interventional,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS), up","Cardiac function, up",oral ketone ester,Ketone ester (KE),NS
34806114,Acute Echocardiographic Effects of Exogenous Ketone Administration in Healthy Participants.,"BACKGROUND: Interest in therapeutic applications of exogenous ketones has grown significantly, spanning patients with heart failure to endurance athletes. Exogenous ketones engender significant effects on cardiac function in heart failure and provide an ergogenic benefit in athletes. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of exogenous ketones on cardiac function in healthy participants. METHODS: In a single-arm intervention study, 20 fasting, healthy participants underwent comprehensive echocardiography (two-dimensional, Doppler, and strain) before and 30 min after weight-based oral ketone ester administration. The relationship between changes in log-transformed biomarker levels and change in absolute global longitudinal strain (GLS) was assessed using linear regression. RESULTS: The mean age was 30 +/- 7 years, 50% were women, 45% were nonwhite, and the average body mass index was 24.3 +/- 3.1 kg/m(2). Ketone ingestion acutely elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate levels from a median of 0.13 mmol/L (interquartile range, 0.10-0.37 mmol/L) to 3.23 mmol/L (interquartile range, 2.40-4.97 mmol/L) (P < .001). After ketone ester consumption, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, biventricular function, left ventricular GLS, and left atrial (LA) strain all augmented, while systemic vascular resistance decreased. Displayed as mean change, increases in ejection fraction (3.1%; 95% CI, 2.0%-4.2%; P < .001), GLS (2.0%; 95% CI, 1.4%-2.7%; P < .001), right ventricular S' (1.1 cm/sec; 95% CI, 0.4-1.8 cm/sec; P = .004), LA reservoir strain (7%; 95% CI, 3%-12%; P = .005), and LA contractile strain (4%; 2%-6%; P = .001) were observed. During robustly achieved ketosis, change in GLS was inversely associated with change in nonesterified fatty acids (P = .019). CONCLUSIONS: In a single-arm study, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, biventricular function, and LV and LA strain acutely augmented after ketone ester ingestion in healthy, fasting participants, similar to several effects observed in the failing heart. These data may provide supporting data for the ergogenic benefits observed in athletes and may become increasingly relevant with exogenous ketone consumption across a variety of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular applications.",0,children with new-onset type 1 diabetes; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mouse model; Fabp4(-/-) mice; wild-type mice,human; animal,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Animal – Mouse,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,adipose tissue,Adipose tissue,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Metabolic & Endocrine,"ketoacidosis, down","ketoacidosis, down",NS,NS,NS

We prospectively evaluated the role of FABP4 in the pathophysiology of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in new-onset type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data were prospectively collected from consecutive children presenting with new-onset type 1 diabetes. In addition to blood chemistry and gases, insulin, C-peptide, serum FABP4 and NEFA were collected upon presentation and 48 h after initiation of insulin treatment. In a mouse model of type 1 diabetes, glucose, insulin, beta-hydroxybutyrate and weight were compared between FABP4 knockout (Fabp4(-/-)) and wild-type (WT) mice. RESULTS: Included were 33 children (mean age 9.3 +/- 3.5 years, 52% male), of whom 14 (42%) presented with DKA. FABP4 levels were higher in the DKA group compared with the non-DKA group (median [IQR] 10.1 [7.9-14.2] ng/ml vs 6.3 [3.9-7] ng/ml, respectively; p = 0.005). The FABP4 level was positively correlated with HbA(1c) at presentation and inversely correlated with venous blood pH and bicarbonate levels (p < 0.05 for all). Following initiation of insulin therapy, a marked reduction in FABP4 was observed in all children. An FABP4 level of 7.22 ng/ml had a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 78% for the diagnosis of DKA, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78 (95% CI 0.6, 0.95; p = 0.008). In a streptozotocin-induced diabetes mouse model, Fabp4(-/-) mice exhibited marked hypoinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia similar to WT mice but displayed no significant increase in beta-hydroxybutyrate and were protected from ketoacidosis. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: FABP4 is suggested to be a necessary regulator of ketogenesis in insulin-deficient states.",0,SI crypts; Lgr5(+) stem cell-enriched epithelial spheroids; intestinal Hmgcs2 knockout,animal; in vitro,In vitro – Organoids/3D cultures; Animal – Mouse,"H3K9bhb enrichment, up",Epigenetic Regulation,small intestine (SI) crypts,Small intestine,Lgr5(+) stem cells,Stem / Progenitor / Pluripotent,Tissue-specific progenitors (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",treated with beta-OHB in vitro; local production of beta-OHB,In vitro media supplementation; Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

We report that Kbhb on histone H3 (H3K9bhb) is enriched at proximal promoters of critical gene subsets associated with lipolytic and ketogenic metabolic pathways in small intestine (SI) crypts during fasting. Similar Kbhb enrichment is observed in Lgr5(+) stem cell-enriched epithelial spheroids treated with beta-OHB in vitro. Combinatorial chromatin state analysis reveals that H3K9bhb is associated with active chromatin states and that fasting enriches for an H3K9bhb-H3K27ac signature at active metabolic gene promoters and distal enhancer elements. Intestinal knockout of Hmgcs2 results in marked loss of H3K9bhb-associated loci, suggesting that local production of beta-OHB is responsible for chromatin reprogramming within the SI crypt. We conclude that modulation of H3K9bhb in SI crypts is a key gene regulatory event in response to fasting.",0,HUVECs; macrophages,human; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells; NS,"antioxidant pathway activation, up; histone deacetylase inhibition, down",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense; Epigenetic Regulation,vascular endothelial cells,Vasculature,HUVECs,Endothelial,Venous endothelial,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

METHODS: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were used to induce macrophages to release proinflammatory factors, and the culture supernatant was collected as a macrophage-conditioned medium (MCM) to culture HUVECs. A total of 7 groups of cells were used in the study: 1 in circlecontrol group, or normal cultured HUVECs; 2 in circleMCM group, or the MCM-cultured HUVECs; groups 3 in circle to ⑦ were all HUVECs co-cultured with different reagents, including 3 in circleMCM+beta-OHB group, 4 in circleMCM+N-acetylcysteine (NAC) group, ⑤MCM+beta-OHB+NAC group, ⑥MCM+beta-OHB+histone deacetylase agonist ITSA1 group, and ⑦MCM+beta-OHB+histone deacetylase inhibitor Entinostat group. MitoSOX immunofluorescence staining was conducted to analyzes the mitochondrial superoxide levels, real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to examine the mRNA expression of antioxidant genes, and Seahorse mitochondrial energy analyzer was used to measure mitochondrial aerobic respiration capacity. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, mitochondrial superoxide production was significantly increased in the MCM cultured HUVECs cells, while beta-OHB treatment significantly inhibited mitochondrial superoxide production, which was accompanied by an increase in the mRNA expression of antioxidant genes, and significant increase in the basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and respiratory reserve capacity. NAC treatment did not further enhance the protective effect of beta-OHB on mitochondrial functions. In addition, ITSA1 treatment could completely offset the antioxidant and mitochondrial protective effects of beta-OHB, and these stated effects were still maintained after Entinostat treatment. CONCLUSION: The ketone body beta-OHB attenuates the mitochondrial oxidative stress of vascular endothelial cells through activating the antioxidant pathway and inhibiting histone deacetylase activity.",0,293T cells; simulated Kbhb antibody (chemically modified in vitro),in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line; In silico / Computational,"beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb), up",Epigenetic Regulation,plasma,Blood,293T cells,Unspecified / Mixed,Cell line (origin unclear),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,COVID-19,Infectious,"protection, up","Seizure protection, up",NS,NS,NS
34880753,Lysine beta-Hydroxybutyrylation Improves Stability of COVID-19 Antibody.,"beta-Hydroxybutyrate (3HB) is a small molecule produced as a ketone body in mammalian animals. It has been found that 3HB provides not only energy for a body, it also participates in cell signal transduction events as a signal molecule. This study focuses on investigation of 3HB immunomodulatory mechanisms. Proteomic analysis indicates a new post-translational modification of beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) on antibodies. Because of the low level of Kbhb antibodies and the associated difficulty in purifying them, simulated Kbhb antibody was produced using chemical modification in vitro. The chemically modified Kbhb antibody was shown to improve the stability of antibodies to protease and heat treatments. Furthermore, Kbhb of antibodies stabilizes the antibodies in plasma. As a remarkable example, COVID-19 neutralizing antibody B38 produced by 293T cells was Kbhb modified and stabilized in vivo, providing a strategy for the possibility of extending the protection effects of COVID-19 antibodies.",0; SOD1; SIRT1; ACHE; ROS1; IL1B; TNF; NLRP3,D-gal-injured C57BL/6 mice; HT22 cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"SIRT1 pathway activation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,hippocampal neuronal cells (HT22),Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Memory impairment,Neurodegenerative,"water maze performance, up","Spatial memory, up",BHBA (administered intragastrically),Oral gavage / Intragastric bolus,NS

Memory impairment is associated with increased oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory response. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) is a water-soluble endogenous small-molecule ketone body that easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and has shown neuroprotection activities. In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of BHBA on D-galactose (D-gal)-induced memory impairment in mice by in vitro and in vivo experiments. BHBA was administered intragastrically to D-gal-injured C57BL/6 mice for 42 days. Water maze performance, the morphology of the hippocampus with Nissl staining, the ACh content, OS, and inflammation status were examined. To further investigate the mechanism, hippocampal neuronal cells (HT22) were treated with BHBA with or without the SIRT1 inhibitor or small interfering RNAs against sirt1 (si-SIRT1) before incubation with D-gal. BHBA significantly improved water maze performance; increased the ACh content, SOD activity, and SIRT1 expression; and decreased AChE and LDH activity, ROS, MDA, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha contents, and NLRP3 expression. Further studies with the SIRT inhibitor or siRNAs against sirt1 reversed the above effects of BHBA. Collectively, BHBA inhibited hippocampal OS and the inflammation process to alleviate learning and memory impairment through activating the SIRT1 pathway in D-gal-injured mice, suggesting that BHBA could be a potential option for drug development of learning and memory impairment induced by nervous system injuries.",0,six healthy male athletes,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"betaHB oxidation, down",Metabolic Regulation,muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketone ester (KE) containing a (13)C label,Ketone ester (KE),NS

Methods: Six healthy male athletes completed 1 h of bicycle ergometer exercise at 75% maximal power (WMax) on three occasions. Prior to exercise, participants consumed 573 mg.kg bw(-1) of a ketone ester (KE) containing a (13)C label. To manipulate CHO availability, athletes undertook glycogen depleting exercise followed by isocaloric high-CHO or very-low-CHO diets. To manipulate fat availability, participants were given a continuous infusion of lipid during two visits. Using stable isotope methodology, beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) oxidation rates were therefore investigated under the following metabolic conditions: (i) high CHO + normal fat (KE+CHO); (ii) high CHO + high fat KE+CHO+FAT); and (iii) low CHO + high fat (KE+FAT). Results: Pre-exercise intramuscular glycogen (IMGLY) was approximately halved in the KE+FAT vs. KE+CHO and KE+CHO+FAT conditions (both p < 0.05). Blood free fatty acids (FFA) and intramuscular long-chain acylcarnitines were significantly greater in the KE+FAT vs. other conditions and in the KE+CHO+FAT vs. KE+CHO conditions before exercise. Following ingestion of the (13)C labeled KE, blood betaHB levels increased to approximately 4.5 mM before exercise in all conditions. betaHB oxidation was modestly greater in the KE+CHO vs. KE+FAT conditions (mean diff. = 0.09 g.min(-1), p = 0.03; d = 0.3), tended to be greater in the KE+CHO+FAT vs. KE+FAT conditions (mean diff. = 0.07 g.min(-1); p = 0.1; d = 0.3) and were the same in the KE+CHO vs. KE+CHO+FAT conditions (p < 0.05; d < 0.1). A moderate positive correlation between pre-exercise IMGLY and betaHB oxidation rates during exercise was present (p = 0.04; r = 0.5). Post-exercise intramuscular betaHB abundance was markedly elevated in the KE+FAT vs. KE+CHO and KE+CHO+FAT conditions (both, p < 0.001; d = 2.3).

Chronic hypertension increases the risk of developing superimposed preeclampsia. Previous reports showed that 1,3-butanediol attenuates hypertension in rodents; however, the therapeutic potential of 1,3-butanediol for the prevention of preeclampsia has not been investigated. This study tested the hypothesis that attenuating hypertension before pregnancy and through the placentation period via 1,3-butanediol prevents the onset of preeclampsia in female Dahl salt-sensitive (SS/Jr) rats. Female Dahl SS/Jr rats were divided into two groups: 1,3-butanediol treated (20% via drinking water) and control (ad libitum water). Both groups were maintained on low-salt rodent chow (Teklad 7034, 0.3% NaCl; n = 8/group). Animals were treated with 1,3-butanediol for 7 wk (baseline), mated, and treated through day 12 of pregnancy. 1,3-Butanediol treatment increased plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (metabolite of 1,3-butanediol) that negatively correlated with maternal body weight in late pregnancy. Mean arterial pressure was lower in the treated group at baseline, early, and mid pregnancy, but no difference was observed in late pregnancy after treatment ended. Uterine artery resistance index (UARI) was reduced in the treated dams. No adverse fetal effects were observed, and there were no differences in pup weight or length. Placentas from treated dams had decreased vascular endothelial growth factor levels as well as decreased placental basal zone thickness and increased labyrinth zone thickness. These findings support the therapeutic role of physiological ketosis via 1,3-butanediol as a potential therapeutic approach for managing chronic hypertension, thereby preventing and mitigating adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with preeclampsia.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A ketogenic diet or increased beta-hydroxybutyrate levels can reduce hypertension, but the potential of 1,3-butanediol, a beta-hydroxybutyrate precursor, for treatment of preeclampsia is unknown. We hypothesized that attenuating hypertension before and during pregnancy via 1,3-butanediol prevents preeclampsia in Dahl Salt-sensitive rats. 1,3-Butanediol significantly lowered blood pressure and improved uterine artery resistance with no observable adverse fetal effects.

This study investigated how this abnormal metabolic disorder influences sepsis in mice. Mice were fed with normal chow (NC) or high-fat diet (HFD), and palmitic acid (PA) was used to treat hepatocytes to mimic fat accumulation in vitro. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce sepsis and related immune responses. Mice fed on a high-fat diet displayed higher mortality and more severe liver damage but compromised immunoreaction. The supernatant from PA-treated primary hepatocytes markedly diminished the inflammatory cytokine expression of macrophages after LPS stimulation, which showed a state of immunosuppression. Metabolomics analysis indicated the level of many key metabolites with possible roles in immunoreaction was altered in the HFD and PA groups compared with corresponding controls; specifically, beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) showed an immunosuppressive effect on Raw264.7 cells during the LPS stimulation. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that several differential signaling pathways may be associated with the alteration of immune function between the NC and HFD groups, as well as in the in vitro model. Our study suggests that the consumption of HFD may alter the hepatic metabolic profile, and that certain metabolites may remold the immune system to immunosuppressive state in the context of sepsis.",0,high-fat diet-fed obese mice; genetically obese db/db mice; normal mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"Fermicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, down",Metabolic Regulation,lung,Lung,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Multi-disease,"methacholine hyperresponsiveness, down","Airway hyperresponsiveness, down",ketogenic diet; ketone ester dietary supplement; ketone ester administration,Ketogenic diet (endogenous); Ketone ester (KE),NS

Substantial weight loss in obese asthmatics or in mouse models of the condition decreases methacholine hyperresponsiveness. Ketone bodies are rapidly elevated during weight loss, coinciding with or preceding relief from asthma-related comorbidities. As ketone bodies may exert numerous potentially therapeutic effects, augmenting their systemic concentrations is being targeted for the treatment of several conditions. Circulating ketone body levels can be increased by feeding a ketogenic diet or by providing a ketone ester dietary supplement, which we hypothesized would exert protective effects in mouse models of inherent obese asthma. Weight loss induced by feeding a low-fat diet to mice previously fed a high-fat diet was preceded by increased urine and blood levels of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Feeding a ketogenic diet for 3 wk to high-fat diet-fed obese mice or genetically obese db/db mice increased BHB concentrations and decreased methacholine hyperresponsiveness without substantially decreasing body weight. Acute ketone ester administration decreased methacholine responsiveness of normal mice, and dietary ketone ester supplementation of high-fat diet-fed mice decreased methacholine hyperresponsiveness. Ketone ester supplementation also transiently induced an ""antiobesogenic"" gut microbiome with a decreased Fermicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio.

Voluntary hypoventilation (VH) with exercise reliably reduces oxygen availability and increases carbon dioxide retention without alterations to ambient pressure or gas content. Utilizing a double-blind randomized crossover design, fifteen recreational male distance runners performed submaximal exercise (4 x 5 min; 70% VO(2) Max) with VH. An exogenous ketone ester (KME; 573 mg⋅kg(-1)) or iso-caloric flavor matched placebo (PLA) was consumed prior to exercise. Metabolites, blood gases, expired air, heart rate, oxygen saturation, cognition, and perception metrics were collected throughout. KME rapidly elevated R-beta-hydroxybutyrate and reduced blood glucose without altering lactate production. KME lowered pH, bicarbonate, and total carbon dioxide. VH with exercise significantly reduced blood (SpO(2)) and muscle (SmO(2)) oxygenation and increased cognitive mean reaction time and respiratory rate regardless of condition. KME administration significantly elevated respiratory exchange ratio (RER) at rest and throughout recovery from VH, compared to PLA. Blood carbon dioxide (PCO(2)) retention increased in the PLA condition while decreasing in the KME condition, leading to a significantly lower PCO(2) value immediately post VH exercise (IPE; p = 0.031) and at recovery (p = 0.001), independent of respiratory rate. The KME's ability to rapidly alter metabolism, acid/base balance, CO(2) retention, and respiratory exchange rate independent of respiratory rate changes at rest, during, and/or following VH exercise protocol illustrates a rapid countermeasure to CO(2) retention in concert with systemic metabolic changes.",PES1; EP300; SREBF1; FASN; SCD; CASP1; NLRP3; GSDMD; IL1B; IL18,Male C57BL/6J mice; KKA(y) mice; McArdle 7777 cells; liver-conditional knockout (CKO) of Pes1 in vivo,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line; Animal – Other Mammal,"CHOP binding to Pes1 promoters, down",Epigenetic Regulation,liver,Liver,hepatocytes,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Type 2 diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"lipid dysregulation, improved; hepatic and plasma triglycerides, down","Lipid profile, improved; Triglycerides, down",ketogenic diet (KD); beta-hydroxybutyric acid (beta-HB),Ketogenic diet (endogenous); Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Simultaneously, McArdle 7777 cells were treated by beta-hydroxybutyric acid (beta-HB), Pes1 siRNA or Pes1 overexpression plasmid, respectively. Additionally, liver-conditional knockout (CKO) of Pes1 in vivo was applied.

In mice with CKO of Pes1, the protein levels of p300, SREBP1c, FASN, SCD1, Caspase1, NLRP3 and GSDMD were dramatically downregulated in livers, and the plasma and hepatic TG, IL-1beta and IL-18 were decreased as well. The similar outcomes were also observed in beta-HB and Pes1 knockdown treated hepatocytes. By contrast, Pes1 overexpression in cultured hepatocytes showed that these levels were significantly enhanced, which were, however reduced under beta-HB treatment. Mechanistically, we discovered that beta-HB decreased CHOP binding to the Pes1 promoters, resulting in the downregulation of PES1, thereby reducing PES1 binding to p300 and Caspase1 promoters. The inhibition of p300 and Caspase1 expression elicited the dramatic suppression of acetylation of SREBP1c via its interaction with p300, and the decreased GSDMD levels. Besides, knockdown of Caspase1 also alleviated the TG levels in cultured hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: KD may improve lipid dysregulation in type 2 diabetic mice by downregulating hepatic PES1 expression.",HADHA; 0; HDAC7; FOXO1,mice; HFD-fed mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"HDAC7 activity, down",Epigenetic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"metabolic disorders, improved","Metabolic disorders, improved",ketone body production via beta-oxidation,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
35053157,The mitochondrial beta-oxidation enzyme HADHA restrains hepatic glucagon response by promoting beta-hydroxybutyrate production.,"Disordered hepatic glucagon response contributes to hyperglycemia in diabetes. The regulators involved in glucagon response are less understood. This work aims to investigate the roles of mitochondrial beta-oxidation enzyme HADHA and its downstream ketone bodies in hepatic glucagon response. Here we show that glucagon challenge impairs expression of HADHA. Liver-specific HADHA overexpression reversed hepatic gluconeogenesis in mice, while HADHA knockdown augmented glucagon response. Stable isotope tracing shows that HADHA promotes ketone body production via beta-oxidation. The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) but not acetoacetate suppresses gluconeogenesis by selectively inhibiting HDAC7 activity via interaction with Glu543 site to facilitate FOXO1 nuclear exclusion. In HFD-fed mice, HADHA overexpression improved metabolic disorders, and these effects are abrogated by knockdown of BHB-producing enzyme. In conclusion, BHB is responsible for the inhibitory effect of HADHA on hepatic glucagon response, suggesting that HADHA activation or BHB elevation by pharmacological intervention hold promise in treating diabetes.",0,2900 deaths (2013–2019); 1069 DKA/AKA/HHS/hypothermia/diabetes/alcoholism/acidosis cases without BHB analysis,human,NS; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"detection, up",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetic ketoacidosis; nan; Hypothermia; Diabetes mellitus; Acidosis,Metabolic & Endocrine; Other / Unspecified; General Signs & Symptoms,"deaths by AKA, up; deaths by acidosis, up; deaths by alcoholism, no-change; deaths by DKA, no-change; deaths by hypothermia, no-change","Mortality, up; Mortality, no-change",NS,NS,NS

Therefore, this study aims at evaluating the effects of BHB analysis on the number of deaths by DKA (diabetes ketoacidosis), AKA (alcoholic ketoacidosis), HHS (hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state), hypothermia, diabetes, alcoholism, and acidosis NOS (not otherwise specified). All 2900 deaths from 2013 through 2019 in which BHB was analysed at the National Board of Forensic Medicine, and 1069 DKA, AKA, HHS, hypothermia, diabetes, alcoholism, and acidosis cases without BHB analysis were included. The prevalence of BHB-positive cases for each cause of death, and trends and proportions of different BHB concentrations, were investigated. The number of BHB analyses/year increased from 13 to 1417. AKA increased from three to 66 and acidosis from one to 20. The deaths from alcoholism, DKA, and hypothermia remained stable. It is unclear why death from alcoholism remained stable while AKA increased. The increase in unspecific acidosis deaths raises the question why a more specific diagnosis had not been used. In conclusion, BHB analysis is instrumental in detecting AKA and acidosis. The scientific basis for the diagnosis of DKA and hypothermia improved, but the number of cases did not change.",0,GSDV patients; healthy controls,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"lipolysis inhibition, down",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Glycogen storage disease type V,Genetic / Congenital,"exercise capacity, no-change","Endurance capacity, no-change",D-beta-hydroxybutyrate esters (KE),Multi-source,D-BHB
35180190,No effect of oral ketone ester supplementation on exercise capacity in patients with McArdle disease and healthy controls: A randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study.,"Patients with glycogen storage disease type V (GSDV), also known as McArdle disease, have blocked glycogen breakdown due to myophosphorylase deficiency, leading to exercise intolerance, muscle pain, and risk of muscle damage. Blood-derived ketone bodies (KBs) constitute an alternative energy source that could fuel the muscle independent of glycogenolysis. However, except for long-time fasting or ketogenic dieting, KBs are present in low quantities. This led us to explore the effects of a drink containing exogenously produced KBs in the form of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate esters (KE) on exercise capacity and metabolism in patients with GSDV. Eight GSDV patients and four healthy controls (HC) were included in this placebo-controlled, cross-over study where subjects were randomized to receive a KE drink with 395 mgKE/kg or placebo drink on two separate days 25 min before a submaximal cycle exercise test. The primary outcome was exercise capacity as indicated by heart rate response (HR) to exercise. Secondary outcomes included perceived exertion (PE) and measures of KB, carbohydrate, and fat metabolism during exercise. In GSDV, the KE drink vs. placebo increased plasma KBs and KB oxidation (p </= 0.0001) but did not improve exercise capacity as judged from HR (p = 0.120) and PE (p = 0.109). In addition, the KE drink lowered plasma glucose, free fatty acids, and lowered lipolytic rate and glucose rate of appearance compared with placebo. Similar results were found in the HC group. The present study indicates that an increase in KB oxidation by oral KE supplementation does not improve exercise capacity in GSDV possibly because of KB-induced inhibition of lipolysis and liver glucose output. Thus, oral KE supplementation alone cannot be recommended as a treatment option for patients with GSDV.",0; AMY1A; IL1B,14 professional firefighters,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"cognitive role, positive",Other / Unspecified,saliva,Salivary gland,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketone monoester (KME; 0.5 g.kg-1),Ketone ester (KE); NS,NS

No effect of a ketone monoester on markers of stress and performance in a live-burn search and rescue in firefighters. J Strength Cond Res 36(3): 763-771, 2022-Firefighters experience a range of stressors that impair performance and elevate the risk for developing cardiometabolic diseases. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) has been shown to mitigate markers of oxidative stress and inflammation and serve as an alternative fuel with implications to physical performance. On 2 occasions in a double-blind, counterbalanced, and crossover design, 14 professional firefighters performed a live-burn, search and rescue (S&R) 30 minutes after ingestion of a ketone monoester (KME; 0.5 g.kg-1) or a placebo (PLA). Dependent variables collected before and after the S&R included salivary markers of stress and inflammation (cortisol, alpha-amylase, interleukin-1 beta, uric acid), perceptual markers (profile of mood state [POMS]), gastrointestinal distress (GI), rating of perceived exertion [RPE]), time to completion, and capillary blood measurement of betaHB and glucose. KME resulted in capillary betaHB concentrations of approximately 2.1-3.2 mM throughout the protocol. Capillary glucose concentrations were lower for the KME compared with PLA ( approximately 7%) (interaction effect, p < 0.001). Salivary markers of stress, GI, and time to complete the S&R ( approximately 10 minutes) did not differ between trials, although KME ingestion resulted in significantly higher RPE after the live-burn S&R (KME,6 +/- 1; PLA, 4 +/- 1). However, POMS data showed the KME also lowered subjective states of nervousness (KME, 0.0 +/- 0.0; PLA, 0.6 +/- 0.8) and anxiety (KME, 0.0 +/- 0.0; PLA, 0.6 +/- 0.7) before the S&R (all p < 0.05; large effect sizes). Compared with PLA, ingestion of a KME by firefighters did not mitigate the rise in various markers of salivary stress or impact physical performance during a live-burn S&R. However, differences in RPE and POMS variables were observed, suggesting a possible cognitive role for betaHB.",GCKR; SLC16A1,primary cultures of tanycytes; hypothalamic slices; GKRP(t)-OE mice; GKRP(t)-KD mice; GKRP(t)-OE rats,animal; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice; Animal – Mouse; Animal – Rat,"POMC neuronal excitability, down",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,arcuate nucleus,Brain/CNS,tanycytes,Neural / Glial,Neural stem/progenitors (NSC/NPC),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Obesity,Metabolic & Endocrine,"post-fasting food avidity, up","Appetite, up",NS,NS,NS
35213817,GKRP-dependent modulation of feeding behavior by tanycyte-released monocarboxylates.,"Objectives: Glucokinase Regulatory Protein (GKRP) is the only known endogenous modulator of glucokinase (GK) localization and activity to date, and both proteins are localized in tanycytes, radial glia-like cells involved in metabolic and endocrine functions in the hypothalamus. However, the role of tanycytic GKRP and its impact on the regulation of feeding behavior has not been investigated. Here, we hypothesize that GKRP regulates feeding behavior by modulating tanycyte-neuron metabolic communication in the arcuate nucleus. Methods: We used primary cultures of tanycytes to evaluate the production of lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB). Similarly, we examined the electrophysiological responses to these metabolites in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in hypothalamic slices. To evaluate the role of GKRP in feeding behavior, we generated tanycyte-selective GKRP-overexpressing and GKRP-knock down mice (GKRP(t)-OE and GKRP(t)-KD respectively) using adenovirus-mediated transduction. Results: We demonstrated that lactate release induced by glucose uptake is favored in GKRP-KD tanycytes. Conversely, tanycytes overexpressing GKRP showed an increase in betaHB efflux induced by low glucose concentration. In line with these findings, the excitability of POMC neurons was enhanced by lactate and decreased in the presence of betaHB. In GKRP(t)-OE rats, we found an increase in post-fasting food avidity, whereas GKRP(t)-KD caused a significant decrease in feeding and body weight, which is reverted when MCT1 is silenced. Conclusion: Our study highlights the role of tanycytic GKRP in metabolic regulation and positions this regulator of GK as a therapeutic target for boosting satiety in patients with obesity problems.",0,recreationally active men (n=13),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"blood ketones, up",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"endurance exercise performance, up","Endurance capacity, up",ketone salts,Ketone salt (KS),NS

However, there is no study comparing this coingestion to the same nutrients without caffeine. We assessed whether ketone salts-caffeine-taurine-leucine (KCT) supplementation was superior to caffeine-free ketone salts-taurine-leucine supplementation (KT), or to an isoenergetic carbohydrate placebo (CHO-PLAC). Thirteen recreationally active men (mean +/- SD: 177.5 +/- 6.1 cm, 75.9 +/- 4.6 kg, 23 +/- 3 years, 12.0 +/- 5.1% body fat) completed a best effort 20-km cycling time-trial, followed 15 min later by a Wingate power cycle test, after supplementing with either KCT (approximately 7 g of beta-hydroxybutyrate, approximately 120 mg of caffeine, 2.1 g of leucine, and 2.7 g of taurine), KT (i.e., same supplement without caffeine), or isoenergetic CHO-PLAC (11 g of dextrose). Blood ketones were elevated (p < .001) after ingestion of both KCT (0.65 +/- 0.12 mmol/L) and KT (0.72 +/- 0.31 mmol/L) relative to CHO-PLAC (0.06 +/- 0.05 mmol/L). Moreover, KCT improved (p < .003) 20-km cycling time-trial performance (37.80 +/- 2.28 min), compared with CHO-PLAC (39.40 +/- 3.33 min) but not versus KT (38.75 +/- 2.87 min; p < .09). 20-km cycling time-trial average power output was greater with KCT (power output = 180.5 +/- 28.7 W) versus both KT (170.9 +/- 31.7 W; p = .049) and CHO-PLAC (164.8 +/- 34.7 W; p = .001). Wingate peak power output was also greater for both KCT (1,134 +/- 137 W; p = .031) and KT (1,132 +/- 128 W; p = .039) versus CHO-PLAC (1,068 +/- 127 W).

However, there is rare effective treatment except for revision surgery, which is costly and painful to the patients. In recent years, the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) has attracted much attention and has been proved to be beneficial in many chronic diseases. With respect to the studies on the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), its anti-inflammatory ability has been widely investigated. Although the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate has been applied in many inflammatory diseases and has achieved considerable therapeutic efficacy, its effect on wear particles induced osteolysis is still unknown. RESULTS: In this work, we confirmed that the anti-inflammatory action of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) could be reappeared in CoCrMo alloy particles induced osteolysis. Mechanistically, the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) deactivated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome triggered by CoCrMo alloy particles. Of note, this inhibitory action was independent of Gpr109a receptor as well as histone deacetylase (HDAC) suppression. Furthermore, given that butyrate, one kind of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) structurally related to beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), has been reported to be an inhibitor of osteoclast, thus we also investigate the effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on osteoclast, which was contributed to bone resorption. It was found that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) did not only affect osteoclast differentiation, but also inhibit its function. Unlike the inflammasome, the effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on osteoclast may mainly rely on histone deacetylase (HDAC) suppression. CONCLUSIONS: In general, our study showed that the alleviation of osteolysis may owe to the effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on inflammasome deactivation and osteoclast.",BDNF,male Wistar rats; rat L6 myoblasts,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Multi-model,"transcriptional induction, up",Epigenetic Regulation,gastrocnemius muscle,Skeletal muscle,L6 myoblasts,Muscle – Skeletal,Myoblasts,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
35339899,Mild Endurance Exercise during Fasting Increases Gastrocnemius Muscle and Prefrontal Cortex Thyroid Hormone Levels through Differential BHB and BCAA-Mediated BDNF-mTOR Signaling in Rats.,"Mild endurance exercise has been shown to compensate for declined muscle quality and may positively affect the brain under conditions of energy restriction. Whether this involves brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in relation to central and peripheral tissue levels of associated factors such as beta hydroxy butyrate (BHB), branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and thyroid hormone (T3) has not been studied. Thus, a subset of male Wistar rats housed at thermoneutrality that were fed or fasted was submitted to 30-min-mild treadmill exercise bouts (five in total, twice daily, 15 m/min, 0 degrees inclination) over a period of 66 h. Prefrontal cortex and gastrocnemius muscle BHB, BCAA, and thyroid hormone were measured by LC-MS/MS analysis and were related to BDNF and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. In gastrocnemius muscle, mild endurance exercise during fasting maintained the fasting-induced elevated BHB levels and BDNF-CREB activity and unlocked the downstream Akt-mTORC1 pathway associated with increased tissue BCAA. Consequently, deiodinase 3 mRNA levels decreased whereas increased phosphorylation of the mTORC2 target FOXO1 was associated with increased deiodinase 2 mRNA levels, accounting for the increased T3 tissue levels. These events were related to increased expression of CREB and T3 target genes beneficial for muscle quality previously observed in this condition. In rat L6 myoblasts, BHB directly induced BDNF transcription and maturation. Mild endurance exercise during fasting did not increase prefrontal cortex BHB levels nor was BDNF activated, whereas increased leucine levels were associated with Akt-independent increased phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target P70S6K. The associated increased T3 levels modulated the expression of known T3-target genes involved in brain tissue maintenance. Our observation that mild endurance exercise modulates BDNF, mTOR and T3 during fasting provides molecular clues to explain the observed beneficial effects of mild endurance exercise in settings of energy restriction.",0,AP clinical cohorts; caerulein-induced AP mouse models (Cer*7; Cer*12),human; animal; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Animal – Mouse; NS,"class I histone deacetylases, NS",Epigenetic Regulation,pancreas,Pancreas,proinflammatory macrophages,Hematopoietic / Immune,Macrophages,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Pancreatitis,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"severity, down","Seizure severity, down","betaOHB; 1,3-butanediol","NS; 1,3-Butanediol (BD)",NS
35340211,Ketogenesis acts as an endogenous protective programme to restrain inflammatory macrophage activation during acute pancreatitis.,"BACKGROUND: Innate immunity and metabolites link to the pathogenesis and severity of acute pancreatitis (AP). However, liver metabolism and its role in immune response and AP progression remain elusive. We investigated the function of liver metabolism in the pathogenesis of AP. METHODS: Circulating ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) levels were determined in AP clinical cohorts and caerulein-induced AP (CER-AP) mouse models receiving seven (Cer*7) or twelve (Cer*12) injection regimens at hourly intervals. Liver transcriptomics and metabolomics were compared between CER-AP (Cer*7) and CER-AP (Cer*12). Inhibition of fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO)-ketogenesis, or supplementation of betaOHB was performed in mouse models of AP. The effect and mechanism of betaOHB were examined in vitro. FINDINGS: Elevated circulating betaOHB was observed in patients with non-severe AP (SAP) but not SAP. These findings were replicated in CER-AP (Cer*7) and CER-AP (Cer*12), which manifested as limited and hyperactive immune responses, respectively. FAO-ketogenesis was activated in CER-AP (Cer*7), while impaired long-chain FAO and mitochondrial function were observed in the liver of CER-AP (Cer*12). Blockage of FAO-ketogenesis (Cpt1a antagonism or Hmgcs2 knockdown) worsened, while supplementation of betaOHB or its precursor 1,3-butanediol alleviated the severity of CER-AP. Mechanistically, betaOHB had a discernible effect on pancreatic acinar cell damage, instead, it greatly attenuated the activation of pancreatic and systemic proinflammatory macrophages via class I histone deacetylases. INTERPRETATION: Our findings reveal that hepatic ketogenesis is activated as an endogenous protective programme to restrain AP progression, indicating its potential therapeutic value.

Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been identified as significant abnormalities in septic cardiomyopathy. However, specific treatments are rare. This study aims to investigate the impact of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) on septic cardiomyopathy and explore the underlying mechanism(s). We found that pretreatment of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol monoester (ketone ester, 3 mg/g body weight, once daily) by gavage for three days elevated the levels of ketone bodies, especially that of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) in the circulation and mouse hearts, which exerted a protective effect against lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 20 mg/kg)-induced septic cardiomyopathy in mice. In addition, an LPS-stimulated macrophage-conditioned medium (MCM) was used to mimic the pathological process of septic cardiomyopathy. Mechanistically, beta-OHB alleviated myocardial oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial respiratory function through the antioxidant FoxO3a/MT2 pathway activated via histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition, which ultimately enhanced heart performance in septic cardiomyopathy. Our results, therefore, suggested an unappreciated critical role of beta-OHB in septic heart protection as well as highlighted the potential of beta-OHB as a simple remedy for the septic cardiomyopathy population.",LEAP2,mice (prolonged fasting; prolonged ketogenic diet; oral BHB treatment); isolated murine hepatocytes; humans (lean and obese individuals; endurance exercise recovery),animal; human; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Human – Interventional; NS; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"downregulation, down",Other / Unspecified,liver,Liver,hepatocytes,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",oral BHB treatment,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
35409148,Beta-Hydroxybutyrate Suppresses Hepatic Production of the Ghrelin Receptor Antagonist LEAP2.,"INTRODUCTION: Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide-2 (LEAP2) is an endogenous ghrelin receptor antagonist, which is upregulated in the fed state and downregulated during fasting. We hypothesized that the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is involved in the downregulation of LEAP2 during conditions with high circulating levels of BHB. METHODS: Hepatic and intestinal Leap2 expression were determined in 3 groups of mice with increasing circulating levels of BHB: prolonged fasting, prolonged ketogenic diet, and oral BHB treatment. LEAP2 levels were measured in lean and obese individuals, in human individuals following endurance exercise, and in mice after BHB treatment. Lastly, we investigated Leap2 expression in isolated murine hepatocytes challenged with BHB. RESULTS: We confirmed increased circulating LEAP2 levels in individuals with obesity compared to lean individuals. The recovery period after endurance exercise was associated with increased plasma levels of BHB levels and decreased LEAP2 levels in humans. Leap2 expression was selectively decreased in the liver after fasting and after exposure to a ketogenic diet for 3 weeks. Importantly, we found that oral administration of BHB increased circulating levels of BHB in mice and decreased Leap2 expression levels and circulating LEAP2 plasma levels, as did Leap2 expression after direct exposure to BHB in isolated murine hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: From our data, we suggest that LEAP2 is downregulated during different states of energy deprivation in both humans and rodents. Furthermore, we here provide evidence that the ketone body, BHB, which is highly upregulated during fasting metabolism, directly downregulates LEAP2 levels. This may be relevant in ghrelin receptor-induced hunger signaling during energy deprivation.",ABCA1; ABCG1; SCARB1,ApoE(-/-) mice fed Western diet; macrophages (in vitro),animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells,"cholesterol transporter protein levels, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,atherosclerosis plaques,Vasculature,macrophages,Hematopoietic / Immune,Macrophages,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Atherosclerosis,Cardiovascular,"lipid accumulation, nan; foam cell formation, down","Lipid profile, nan; Foam cell formation, down",in vivo or in vitro treatment; increased serum BHB after exercise,NS,NS
35422042,Exercise Ameliorates Atherosclerosis via Up-Regulating Serum beta-Hydroxybutyrate Levels.,"Atherosclerosis, accompanied by inflammation and metabolic disorders, is the primary cause of clinical cardiovascular death. In recent years, unhealthy lifestyles (e.g., sedentary lifestyles) have contributed to a worldwide epidemic of atherosclerosis. Exercise is a known treatment of atherosclerosis, but the precise mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we show that 12 weeks of regular exercise training on a treadmill significantly decreased lipid accumulation and foam cell formation in ApoE(-/-) mice fed with a Western diet, which plays a critical role in the process of atherosclerosis. This was associated with an increase in beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) levels in the serum. We provide evidence that BHB treatment in vivo or in vitro increases the protein levels of cholesterol transporters, including ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI, and is capable of reducing lipid accumulation. It also ameliorated autophagy in macrophages and atherosclerosis plaques, which play an important role in the step of cholesterol efflux. Altogether, an increase in serum BHB levels after regular exercise is an important mechanism of exercise inhibiting the development of atherosclerosis. This provides a novel treatment for atherosclerotic patients who are unable to undertake regular exercise for whatever reason.

However, the role of BHB in intestinal inflammation has not yet been investigated. METHODS: Colonic mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and healthy controls were collected for evaluation of BHB level. Besides, the therapeutic effect of exogenous BHB in a murine model of acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis were assessed by body weight change, colon length, disease activity index, and histopathological sections. The regulatory effectors of BHB were analyzed by RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, and microbe analysis in vivo. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of BHB was further verified in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). RESULTS: In this study, significantly reduced BHB levels were found in the colonic mucosa from IBD patients and correlated with IBD activity index. In addition, we demonstrated that the administration of exogenous BHB alleviated the severity of acute experimental colitis, which was characterized by less weight loss, disease activity index, colon shortening, and histology scores, as well as decreased crypt loss and epithelium damage. Furthermore, BHB resulted in significantly increased colonic expression of M2 macrophage-associated genes, including IL-4Ra, IL-10, arginase 1 (Arg-1), and chitinase-like protein 3, following DSS exposure, suggesting an increased M2 macrophage skewing in vivo. Moreover, an in vitro experiment revealed that the addition of BHB directly promoted STAT6 phosphorylation and M2 macrophage-specific gene expression in IL-4-stimulated macrophages. Besides, we found that BHB obviously increased M2 macrophage-induced mucosal repair through promoting intestinal epithelial proliferation. However, the enhancement effect of BHB on M2 macrophage-induced mucosal repair and anti-inflammation was completely inhibited by the STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we show that BHB promotes M2 macrophage polarization through the STAT6-dependent signaling pathway, which contributes to the resolution of intestinal inflammation and the repair of damaged intestinal tissues.

The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) suppresses the NLRP3 inflammasome and alters intracellular signalling pathways in vitro and in animal models; however, this effect has not yet been shown in vivo in humans. The purpose of this single-arm pilot trial was to determine if consuming 15 mL of C(8) medium-chain triglyceride (trioctanoin; MCT) oil, which induces mild elevation of betaHB, twice daily (30 mL total) for 14 days would suppress markers of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in young, healthy humans while following their habitual diet. Consuming a single dose of 15 mL of C(8) MCT oil significantly raised blood betaHB from fasting at 60 minutes and 120 minutes post ingestion (both P < 0.05). However, consumption of C(8) MCT oil for 14 days did not impact markers of monocyte NLRP3 inflammasome activation compared to baseline. Specifically, caspase-1 activation and secretion of its downstream product interleukin (IL)-1beta were unchanged following 14 days of C(8) MCT oil supplementation when measured in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated whole blood cultures (all P > 0.05). Acetylation of histone H3 on the lysine residue 9 was unchanged (P < 0.05) and acetylation of lysine residue 14 was decreased (P < 0.05) following 14 days of supplementation. Thus, adding twice daily C(8) MCT oil supplementation to the habitual diet of young, healthy humans does not appear to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",0,professional male rugby union players,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"fuel metabolism, down",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"high-intensity running performance, up; sprint and power-based performance, no-change","Exercise capacity, up; Exercise capacity, no-change",beta-hydroxybutyrate monoester (BHB-ME),Multi-source,NS

Nine professional male rugby union players each completed two trials in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Participants ingested either 90 +/- 9 g carbohydrate (CHO; 9% solution) or an energy matched solution containing 20 +/- 2 g CHO (3% solution) and 590 mg/kg body mass beta-hydroxybutyrate monoester (CHO + BHB-ME) before and during a simulated rugby union-specific match-play protocol, including repeated high-intensity, sprint and power-based performance tests. Mean time to complete the sustained high-intensity performance tests was reduced by 0.33 +/- 0.41 s (2.1%) with CHO + BHB-ME (15.53 +/- 0.52 s) compared with CHO (15.86 +/- 0.80 s) placebo (p = .04). Mean time to complete the sprint and power-based performance tests were not different between trials. CHO + BHB-ME resulted in blood BHB concentrations that remained >2 mmol/L during exercise (p < .001). Serum lactate and glycerol concentrations were lower after CHO + BHB-ME than CHO (p < .05). Coingestion of a BHB-ME with CHO can alter fuel metabolism (attenuate circulating lactate and glycerol concentrations) and may improve high-intensity running performance during a simulated rugby match-play protocol, without improving shorter duration sprint and power-based efforts.",GLO1; 0,mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"MGO detoxification, up",Metabolic Regulation,spinal dorsal horn,Spinal cord,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Nociception,General Signs & Symptoms,"nociception, down","Pain sensitivity, down",ketogenic diet; beta-HB,Ketogenic diet (endogenous); NS,NS
35507699,Ketogenic diet prevents methylglyoxal-evoked nociception by scavenging methylglyoxal.,"Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a reactive dicarbonyl byproduct of glycolysis implicated in a growing number of neuropathic pain conditions, including chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and radiculopathy with lumbar disk herniation. Recent studies show success in preclinical models treating these disorders with an interventional ketogenic diet. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a ketogenic diet modifies pathological MGO signaling as a mechanism underlying neuropathy improvement. We found that mice injected with MGO displayed nocifensive behaviors, whereas mice prefed a ketogenic diet were resistant to mechanical allodynia elicited by MGO. In addition, levels of circulating MGO were reduced in ketogenic diet-fed mice and negatively correlated with levels of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB). Methylglyoxal is normally scavenged by the glyoxalase system, and ketogenic diet-fed mice displayed increased glyoxalase 1 activity compared with chow-fed control mice. Recent studies also suggest that ketone bodies contribute to MGO detoxification, consistent with a negative correlation between beta-HB and MGO. To assess whether ketone bodies modified MGO-evoked nociception through direct MGO detoxification, we coincubated either acetoacetate or beta-HB with MGO before injection. Mice receiving intraplantar MGO injection exhibit increased nociceptive behavior (lifting, licking, biting, and scratching), which was significantly reduced by coincubation with either acetoacetate or beta-HB. Methylglyoxal increased phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase-positive cells in the spinal dorsal horn, and this evoked spinal activation was ameliorated by preincubation with acetoacetate or beta-HB. These results suggest that a ketogenic diet and ketone bodies ameliorate MGO-evoked nociception, partially through detoxification of MGO, and provide rationale for therapeutic intervention with a ketogenic diet in MGO-driven pathologies.",GCG; 0,NS,NS,NS,"reduction in serum glucagon, down",Hormonal Regulation,blood/serum,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Antipsychotic-induced hyperglycemia,Metabolic & Endocrine,"hyperglycaemia, no-change","Blood glucose, no-change",beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
35513524,Fasting or the short-term consumption of a ketogenic diet protects against antipsychotic-induced hyperglycaemia in mice.,"Antipsychotic (AP) medications, such as olanzapine (OLZ), are used in the treatment of schizophrenia and a growing number of 'off-label' conditions. A single dose of OLZ causes robust increases in blood glucose within minutes of treatment. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether interventions that increase circulating ketone bodies (fasting, beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), ketone esters or a ketogenic diet (KD)) would be sufficient to protect against the acute metabolic side effects of OLZ. We demonstrate that fasting or the short-term consumption of a KD protects against OLZ-induced hyperglycaemia, independent of alterations in whole-body insulin action, and in parallel with a blunted rise in serum glucagon. Interestingly, the effects of fasting and KDs were not recapitulated by acutely increasing circulating concentrations of ketone bodies through treatment with betaHB or oral ketone esters, approaches which increase ketone bodies to physiological or supra-physiological levels, respectively. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that fasting and the short-term consumption of a KD can protect against acute AP-induced perturbations in glucose homeostasis, whereas manipulations which acutely increase circulating ketone bodies do not elicit the same beneficial effects. KEY POINTS: Antipsychotic medications cause rapid and robust increases in blood glucose. Co-treatment approaches to offset these harmful metabolic side effects have not been identified. We demonstrate that fasting or the consumption of a short-term ketogenic diet, but not treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate or oral ketone esters, protects against acute antipsychotic-induced hyperglycaemia. The protective effects of fasting and ketogenic diets were paralleled by reductions in serum glucagon, but not improvements in whole-body insulin action.",PPARA; PPARGC1A; STK11; 0; NFE2L2; CAT; UCP2,neonatal rat cardiomyocytes; Fgf21(-/-) mice; cmFgf21(-/-) mice; wild-type (WT) mice; Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Animal – Mouse,"PPARalpha activation, up",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,neonatal rat cardiomyocytes,Muscle – Cardiac,Cardiomyocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"oxidative stress response gene expression, up","Oxidative stress, up",NS,NS,NS

However, it remains elusive about the signaling elicited by ketone and FGF21 in the heart. Stimulation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with betaOHB and FGF21 induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and PGC1alpha expression along with the phosphorylation of LKB1 and AMPK. betaOHB and FGF21 induced transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE)-containing genes through an activation of PPARalpha. Additionally, betaOHB and FGF21 induced the expression of Nrf2, a master regulator for oxidative stress response, and catalase and Ucp2 genes. We evaluated the oxidative stress response gene expression after 24 h fast in global Fgf21-null (Fgf21(-/-)) mice, cardiomyocyte-specific FGF21-null (cmFgf21(-/-)) mice, wild-type (WT), and Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Fgf21(-/-) mice but not cmFgf21(-/-) mice had unexpectedly higher serum betaOHB levels, and higher expression levels of PPARalpha and oxidative stress response genes than WT mice or Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Notably, expression levels of oxidative stress response genes were significantly correlated with serum betaOHB and PGC1alpha levels in both WT and Fgf21(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that fasting-induced betaOHB and circulating FGF21 coordinately regulate oxidative stress response gene expression in the heart.",0; LOXL2; FN1; ZFP36,obese mice fed a high fat diet; primary cultured murine adipose progenitors; 3T3-L1 fibroblasts; patients with obesity eligible for bariatric surgery (30 patients),animal; in vitro; human,Animal – Mouse; Multi-model; In vitro – Immortalized cell line; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"ZFP36-mediated mRNA degradation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,adipose tissue,Adipose tissue,adipose progenitors,Stem / Progenitor / Pluripotent,Tissue-specific progenitors (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Adipose tissue fibrosis,Metabolic & Endocrine,"adipose tissue fibrotic score, down","Fibrosis, down",circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate levels,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
35582986,Beta-hydroxybutyrate dampens adipose progenitors' profibrotic activation through canonical Tgfbeta signaling and non-canonical ZFP36-dependent mechanisms.,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Adipose tissue contains progenitor cells that contribute to beneficial tissue expansion when needed by de novo adipocyte formation (classical white or beige fat cells with thermogenic potential). However, in chronic obesity, they can exhibit an activated pro-fibrotic, extracellular matrix (ECM)-depositing phenotype that highly aggravates obesity-related adipose tissue dysfunction. METHODS: Given that progenitors' fibrotic activation and fat cell browning appear to be antagonistic cell fates, we have examined the anti-fibrotic potential of pro-browning agents in an obesogenic condition. RESULTS: In obese mice fed a high fat diet, thermoneutral housing, which induces brown fat cell dormancy, increases the expression of ECM gene programs compared to conventionally raised animals, indicating aggravation of obesity-related tissue fibrosis at thermoneutrality. In a model of primary cultured murine adipose progenitors, we found that exposure to beta-hydroxybutyrate selectively reduced Tgfbeta-dependent profibrotic responses of ECM genes like Ctgf, Loxl2 and Fn1. This effect is observed in both subcutaneous and visceral-derived adipose progenitors, as well as in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. In 30 patients with obesity eligible for bariatric surgery, those with higher circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate levels have lower subcutaneous adipose tissue fibrotic scores. Mechanistically, beta-hydroxybutyrate limits Tgfbeta-dependent collagen accumulation and reduces Smad2-3 protein expression and phosphorylation in visceral progenitors. Moreover, beta-hydroxybutyrate induces the expression of the ZFP36 gene, encoding a post-transcriptional regulator that promotes the degradation of mRNA by binding to AU-rich sites within 3'UTRs. Importantly, complete ZFP36 deficiency in a mouse embryonic fibroblast line from null mice, or siRNA knock-down in primary progenitors, indicate that ZFP36 is required for beta-hydroxybutyrate anti-fibrotic effects. CONCLUSION: These data unravel the potential of beta-hydroxybutyrate to limit adipose tissue matrix deposition, a finding that might exploited in an obesogenic context.",PRKACA; BDNF; CREB1; BCL2; BAX; CASP3; CYCS,heat-stressed mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"mitochondrial membrane potential, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,NS,NS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Heat stress,Toxicology / Poisoning,"cognitive and learning abilities, up","Cognition, up",ethyl beta-hydroxybutyrate (HBET),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Results showed that the combination of HT-ac + HBET improved the cognitive and learning abilities of heat-stressed mice, which were tested by Morris water maze, shuttle box, and jumping stage tests. The combination of HT-ac + HBET maintained the integrity of neurons and mitochondria of heat-stressed mice.

However, the effects of fasting on muscle regeneration are largely unknown. Here, we report that fasting slows muscle repair both immediately after the conclusion of fasting as well as after multiple days of refeeding. We show that ketosis, either endogenously produced during fasting or a ketogenic diet or exogenously administered, promotes a deep quiescent state in muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Although deep quiescent MuSCs are less poised to activate, slowing muscle regeneration, they have markedly improved survival when facing sources of cellular stress. Furthermore, we show that ketone bodies, specifically beta-hydroxybutyrate, directly promote MuSC deep quiescence via a nonmetabolic mechanism. We show that beta-hydroxybutyrate functions as an HDAC inhibitor within MuSCs, leading to acetylation and activation of an HDAC1 target protein p53.

However, the exact mechanism underlying the sex-differential effects remains unclear. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of EE on metabolism, body composition, and behavioral phenotype based on sex. Long-term exposure to EE for 8 weeks induced metabolic changes and fat reduction. In response to the change in metabolism, the level of betaHB were influenced by sex and EE possibly in accordance to the phases of estrogen cycle. The expression of beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB)-related genes and proteins such as monocarboxylate transporters, histone deacetylases (HDAC), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were significantly regulated. In cerebral cortex and hippocampus, EE resulted in a significant increase in the level of betaHB and a significant reduction in HDAC, consequently enhancing BDNF expression. Moreover, EE exerted significant effects on motor and cognitive behaviors, indicating a significant functional improvement in female mice under the condition that asserts the influence of estrogen cycle. Using an ovariectomized mice model, the effects of EE and estrogen treatment proved the hypothesis that EE upregulates beta-hydroxybutyrate and BDNF underlying functional improvement in female mice. The above findings demonstrate that long-term exposure to EE can possibly alter metabolism by increasing the level of betaHB, regulate the expression of betaHB-related proteins, and improve behavioral function as reflected by motor and cognitive presentation following the changes in estrogen level. This finding may lead to a marked improvement in metabolism and neuroplasticity by EE and estrogen level.",AGRP,wild-type mice; GPR109A knockout mice; isolated chromaffin cells; adrenal slices,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"GPR109A activation, up",Inflammation & Immune Response,adrenal medulla,Adrenal gland,chromaffin cells,Endocrine (non-pancreatic),Adrenal chromaffin cells,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",a ketone body,NS,NS
35614576,The beta-Hydroxybutyrate-GPR109A Receptor Regulates Fasting-induced Plasticity in the Mouse Adrenal Medulla.,"During fasting, increased sympathoadrenal activity leads to epinephrine release and multiple forms of plasticity within the adrenal medulla including an increase in the strength of the preganglionic --> chromaffin cell synapse and elevated levels of agouti-related peptide (AgRP), a peptidergic cotransmitter in chromaffin cells. Although these changes contribute to the sympathetic response, how fasting evokes this plasticity is not known. Here we report these effects involve activation of GPR109A (HCAR2). The endogenous agonist of this G protein-coupled receptor is beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body whose levels rise during fasting. In wild-type animals, 24-hour fasting increased AgRP-ir in adrenal chromaffin cells but this effect was absent in GPR109A knockout mice. GPR109A agonists increased AgRP-ir in isolated chromaffin cells through a GPR109A- and pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway. Incubation of adrenal slices in nicotinic acid, a GPR109A agonist, mimicked the fasting-induced increase in the strength of the preganglionic --> chromaffin cell synapse. Finally, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments confirmed the mouse adrenal medulla contains GPR109A messenger RNA. These results are consistent with the activation of a GPR109A signaling pathway located within the adrenal gland. Because fasting evokes epinephrine release, which stimulates lipolysis and the production of beta-hydroxybutyrate, our results indicate that chromaffin cells are components of an autonomic-adipose-hepatic feedback circuit. Coupling a change in adrenal physiology to a metabolite whose levels rise during fasting is presumably an efficient way to coordinate the homeostatic response to food deprivation.",0,trained endurance athletes; CHO; Ex Ket; End Ket,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; In vitro – Immortalized cell line; NS,"fat oxidation, up",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"exercise capacity, up; exercise capacity, down; postprandial insulin sensitivity, down","Endurance capacity, up; Endurance capacity, down; Insulin sensitivity, down",ketone drink four-times daily; ketogenic diet,NS; Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
35649469,The effects of endogenously- and exogenously-induced hyperketonemia on exercise performance and adaptation.,"Elevating blood ketones may enhance exercise capacity and modulate adaptations to exercise training; however, these effects may depend on whether hyperketonemia is induced endogenously through dietary carbohydrate restriction, or exogenously through ketone supplementation. To determine this, we compared the effects of endogenously- and exogenously-induced hyperketonemia on exercise capacity and adaptation. Trained endurance athletes undertook 6 days of laboratory based cycling (""race"") whilst following either: a carbohydrate-rich control diet (n = 7; CHO); a carbohydrate-rich diet + ketone drink four-times daily (n = 7; Ex Ket); or a ketogenic diet (n = 7; End Ket). Exercise capacity was measured daily, and adaptations in exercise metabolism, exercise physiology and postprandial insulin sensitivity (via an oral glucose tolerance test) were measured before and after dietary interventions. Urinary beta-hydroxybutyrate increased by ⁓150-fold and ⁓650-fold versus CHO with Ex Ket and End Ket, respectively. Exercise capacity was increased versus pre-intervention by ~5% on race day 1 with CHO (p < 0.05), by 6%-8% on days 1, 4, and 6 (all p < 0.05) with Ex Ket and decreased by 48%-57% on all race days (all p > 0.05) with End Ket. There was an ⁓3-fold increase in fat oxidation from pre- to post-intervention (p < 0.05) with End Ket and increased perceived exercise exertion (p < 0.05). No changes in exercise substrate metabolism occurred with Ex Ket, but participants had blunted postprandial insulin sensitivity (p < 0.05).

35674929,Expression and activation of the ketone body receptor HCAR2/GPR109A promotes preservation of retinal endothelial cell barrier function.,"Preservation of retinal barrier function is critical to maintenance of retinal health. Therefore, it is not surprising that loss of barrier integrity is a pathologic feature common to degenerative retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. Our prior studies demonstrate the importance of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2/GPR109A (HCAR2/GPR109A) expression in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to outer retinal barrier integrity. However, whether HCAR2/GPR109A is expressed in retinal endothelial cells and has a similar relationship to inner blood retinal barrier regulation is not known. In the current study, we examined relevance of receptor expression to endothelial cell dependent-blood retinal barrier integrity. siRNA technology was used to modulate HCAR2/GPR109A expression in human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs). Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of VEGF, a pro-inflammatory stimulus, and/or various concentrations of the HCAR2/GPR109A-specific agonist beta-hydyroxybutyrate (BHB). HCAR2/GPR109A expression was monitored by qPCR and electrical cell impedance sensing (ECIS) was used to evaluate barrier function. Complementary in vivo studies were conducted in wildtype and HCAR2/GPR109A knockout mice treated intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide and/or BHB. Vascular leakage was monitored using fluorescein angiography and Western blot analyses of albumin extravasation. Additionally, retinal function was evaluated by OptoMotry. Decreased (siRNA knockdown) or absent (gene knockout) HCAR2/GPR109A expression was associated with impaired barrier function both in vitro and in vivo. BHB treatment provided some protection, limiting disruptions in retinal barrier integrity and function; an effect that was found to be receptor (HCAR2/GPR109A)-dependent. Collectively, the present studies support a key role for HCAR2/GPR109A in regulating blood-retinal barrier integrity and highlight the therapeutic potential of the receptor toward preventing and treating retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy in which compromised barrier function is paramount.",0,mouse; unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion (90 min),animal,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Other Mammal,"mitochondrial respiration, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Transient ischemic attack,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"neurological score, up","Neurological deficit score, up",BHB (30 mg/kg),NS,NS

In the present work, we induced transient ischemia in mouse brain by unilaterally occluding the middle cerebral artery for 90 min. BHB (30 mg/kg), given immediately after reperfusion, significantly improved the neurological score determined after 24 h. In isolated mitochondria from mouse brain, oxygen consumption by the complexes I, II and IV was reduced immediately after ischemia but recovered slowly over 1 week. The single acute BHB administration after reperfusion improved complex I and II activity after 24 h while no significant effects were seen at later time points. After 24 h, plasma and brain BHB concentrations were strongly increased while mitochondrial intermediates (citrate, succinate) were unchanged in brain tissue. Our data suggest that a single administration of BHB may improve mitochondrial respiration for 1-2 days but not for later time points.

However, the underlying physiological mechanism of this antidiuretic effect remained unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether acute exogenous ketosis by oral ingestion of ketone ester (KE) during a simulated cycling race (RACE) affects the hormonal pathways implicated in fluid balance regulation during exercise. In a double-blind crossover design, 11 well-trained male cyclists participated in RACE consisting of a 3-h submaximal intermittent cycling (IMT(180')) bout followed by a 15-min time trial (TT(15')) in an environmental chamber set at 28 degrees C and 60% relative humidity. Fluid intake was adjusted to maintain euhydration. Before and during RACE, the subjects received either a control drink (CON) or the ketone ester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (KE), which elevated blood beta-hydroxybutyrate to approximately 2-4 mM. Urine output during IMT(180') was approximately 20% lower in KE (1,172 +/- 557 mL) than in CON (1,431 +/- 548 mL, P < 0.05). Compared with CON, N-terminal proatrial natriuretic peptide (NT-pro ANP) concentration during RACE was approximately 20% lower in KE (P < 0.05). KE also raised plasma noradrenaline concentrations during RACE. Performance in TT(15') was similar between CON and KE. In conclusion, exogenous ketosis suppresses diuresis and downregulates NT-pro ANP secretion during exercise.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We previously demonstrated that exogenous ketosis reduces urine production during exercise, however, the underlying physiological mechanism remained unclear. Here, we, for the first time demonstrate that exogenous ketosis suppresses the exercise-induced release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). However, given the limited effects of ANP on renal haemodynamics during exercise, the underlying physiological mechanism remains unknown. But downregulation of ANP might explain a new physiological mechanism by which exogenous ketosis lowers blood-free fatty acid levels.",0,rat model of cardiac arrest (asphyxia),animal,Animal – Rat,"mitochondrial fission, down",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,brain,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Ischemic stroke,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"neurological function, up","Neurological deficit score, up",200 mg/kg beta-HB by intraperitoneal injection,Intraperitoneal BHB,NS

However, the role of beta-HB in the regulation of neurological injury after cardiac arrest (CA) remains unclear. We investigated the effect of beta-HB on brain mitochondrial dysfunction and neurological function after CA. A rat model of CA was established by asphyxia. The rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, control group, and beta-HB group. Animals received 200 mg/kg beta-HB or same volume vehicle at 10 minutes after return of spontaneous circulation by intraperitoneal injection. Neurological function was evaluated by neurologic deficit score and Y-maze. Neuronal cell loss and apoptosis were detected through hematoxylin-eosin staining, Nissl staining, and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Oxidative stress levels were determined by immunohistochemical staining of 4-hydoxynonenal and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. Furthermore, mitochondrial ultrastructure of brain cells was observed by transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the protein expression levels of Bak, caspase 3, gasdermin D, caspase 1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), and phospho-Drp1 (ser616) were measured. We found that neurological function and survival rate were significantly higher in the beta-HB group compared with the control group. beta-HB also reduced neurons death and neurological oxidative stress after CA. Moreover, beta-HB reduced neurological injury from apoptosis and pyroptosis after CA. In addition, beta-HB maintained the structural integrity of brain mitochondria, prevented mitochondrial fission, and increased brain energy metabolism after CA. In conclusion, beta-HB beneficially affected the neurological function of rats after global cerebral ischemia, associated with decreased mitochondrial fission, and improved mitochondrial function.

SUMMARY ANSWER: In vitro betaOHB exposure at ketogenic diet (KD)-relevant serum concentrations significantly impaired preimplantation mouse embryo development, induced aberrant glycolytic metabolism and reduced post-transfer fetal viability in a sex-specific manner. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: A maternal KD in humans elevates gamete and offspring betaOHB exposure during conception and gestation, and in rodents is associated with an increased time to pregnancy, and altered offspring organogenesis, post-natal growth and behaviour, suggesting a developmental programming effect. In vitro exposure to betaOHB at supraphysiological concentrations (8-80 mM) perturbs preimplantation mouse embryo development. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A mouse model of embryo development and viability was utilized for this laboratory-based study. Embryo culture media were supplemented with betaOHB at KD-relevant concentrations, and the developmental competence, physiology, epigenetic state and post-transfer viability of in vitro cultured betaOHB-exposed embryos was assessed. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Mouse embryos were cultured in vitro with or without betaOHB at concentrations representing serum levels during pregnancy (0.1 mM), standard diet consumption (0.25 mM), KD consumption (2 mM) and diabetic ketoacidosis (4 mM). The impact of betaOHB exposure on embryo development (blastocyst formation rate, morphokinetics and blastocyst total, inner cell mass and trophectoderm (TE) cell number), physiology (redox state, betaOHB metabolism, glycolytic metabolism), epigenetic state (histone 3 lysine 27 beta-hydroxybutyrylation, H3K27bhb) and post-transfer viability (implantation rate, fetal and placental development) was assessed. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: All betaOHB concentrations tested slowed embryo development (P < 0.05), and betaOHB at KD-relevant serum levels (2 mM) delayed morphokinetic development, beginning at syngamy (P < 0.05). Compared with unexposed controls, betaOHB exposure reduced blastocyst total and TE cell number (>/=0.25 mM; P < 0.05), reduced blastocyst glucose consumption (2 mM; P < 0.01) and increased lactate production (0.25 mM; P < 0.05) and glycolytic flux (0.25 and 2 mM; P < 0.01). Consumption of betaOHB by embryos, mediated via monocarboxylate transporters, was detected throughout preimplantation development. Supraphysiological (20 mM; P < 0.001), but not physiological (0.25-4 mM) betaOHB elevated H3K27bhb levels. Preimplantation betaOHB exposure at serum KD levels (2 mM) reduced post-transfer viability. Implantation and fetal development rates of betaOHB-treated embryos were 50% lower than controls (P < 0.05), and resultant fetuses had a shorter crown-rump length (P < 0.01) and placental diameter (P < 0.05). A strong sex-specific effect of betaOHB was detected, whereby female fetuses from betaOHB-treated embryos weighed less (P < 0.05), had a shorter crown-rump length (P < 0.05), and tended to have accelerated ear development (P < 0.08) compared with female control fetuses. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study only assessed embryo development, physiology and viability in a mouse model utilizing in vitro betaOHB exposure; the impact of in vivo exposure was not assessed. The concentrations of betaOHB utilized were modelled on blood/serum levels as the true oviduct and uterine concentrations are currently unknown. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings indicate that the development, physiology and viability of mouse embryos is detrimentally impacted by preimplantation exposure to betaOHB within a physiological range. Maternal diets which increase betaOHB levels, such as a KD, may affect preimplantation embryo development and may therefore impair subsequent viability and long-term health. Consequently, our initial observations warrant follow-up studies in larger human populations. Furthermore, analysis of betaOHB concentrations within human and rodent oviduct and uterine fluid under different nutritional states is also required.

Although evidence suggests that KEbetaHB can offer several therapeutic benefits, whether KEbetaHB affects lipid profile is still unknown. AIMS: The primary aim was to study the effect of KEbetaHB on plasma lipid profile in individuals with prediabetes. The secondary aim was to investigate the role of saturated fat intake in that effect. METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial with cross-over design. Following an overnight fast, 18 adults (six women and 12 men) with prediabetes (diagnosed based on the American Diabetes Association criteria) ingested a single dose of KEbetaHB drink or placebo drink. Blood samples were collected every 30 min, from baseline to 150 min. Outcome variables included changes in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, remnant cholesterol, triglycerides, and the triglycerides to HDL cholesterol ratio. The area under the curve (AUC) over 150 min was calculated for each outcome following ingestion of the drinks. Habitual saturated fat intake was ascertained using the EPIC-Norfolk food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Significant elevation of blood beta-hydroxybutyrate from 0.2 mmol/L to 3.5 mmol/L (p < 0.001) was achieved within 30 min. Acute ketosis resulted in significantly lower AUCs for remnant cholesterol (p = 0.022) and triglycerides (p = 0.022). No statistically significant differences in the AUCs for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and the triglycerides to HDL cholesterol ratio were found. The changes in remnant cholesterol and triglycerides were statistically significant in individuals with high, but not low, habitual saturated fat intake. CONCLUSION: Acute ketosis had no untoward effect on plasma lipid profile. Moreover, it led to significantly reduced circulating levels of remnant cholesterol and triglycerides. This paves the way for investigating whether exogenous ketone supplementation reduces cardiovascular disease risk (via its actions on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins) in at-risk populations.

35894849,Effects of Prolonged Intermittent Fasting Model on Energy Metabolism and Mitochondrial Functions in Neurons.,"BACKGROUND: Calorie restriction (CR) during daily nutrition has been shown to affect the prognosis of many chronic diseases such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and aging. As an alternative nutrition model, prolonged intermittent fasting (PF) in humans is defined by the absence of food for more than 12 h. In our previous human studies, CR and PF models were compared and it was concluded that the two models might have differences in signal transduction mechanisms. We have investigated the effects of these models on neurons at the molecular level in this study. METHODS: Neurons (SH-SY5Y) were incubated with normal medium (N), calorie-restricted medium (CR), fasting medium (PF), and glucose-free medium (G0) for 16 h. Simultaneously, ketone (beta-hydroxybutyrate; bOHB) was added to other experiment flasks containing the same media. Concentrations of lactate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bOHB, and glucose were measured to demonstrate the changes in the energy metabolism together with the mitochondrial functions of cells. Citrate synthase activity and flow cytometric mitochondrial functions were investigated. RESULTS: At the end of incubations, lactate and LDH levels were decreased and mitochondrial activity was increased in all ketone-added groups (P < .01) regardless of the glucose concentration in the environment. In the fasting model, these differences were more prominent. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that neurons use ketones regardless of the amount of glucose, and bOHB-treated cells had positive changes in mitochondrial function. We conclude that the presence of bOHB might reverse neuron damage and that exogenous ketone treatment may be beneficial in the treatment of neurological diseases in the future.",HDAC9,CKD patients; CKD rats; VitD3-overloaded mice; human VSMCs; arterial rings; aortic rings,human; animal; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Animal – Rat; Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"HDAC9 expression, down",Epigenetic Regulation,vasculature,Vasculature,vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs),Muscle – Smooth / Perivascular,Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Chronic kidney disease,Renal & Urological,"vascular calcification, down","Vascular calcification, down","1,3-butanediol (1,3-B)","1,3-Butanediol (BD)",NS
35898407,Downregulation of HDAC9 by the ketone metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate suppresses vascular calcification.,"Vascular calcification is an actively regulated process resembling bone formation and contributes to the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, an effective therapy for vascular calcification is still lacking. The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) has been demonstrated to have health-promoting effects including anti-inflammation and cardiovascular protective effects. However, whether BHB protects against vascular calcification in CKD remains unclear. In this study, Alizarin Red staining and calcium content assay showed that BHB reduced calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and arterial rings. Of note, compared with CKD patients without thoracic calcification, serum BHB levels were lower in CKD patients with thoracic calcification. Supplementation with 1,3-butanediol (1,3-B), the precursor of BHB, attenuated aortic calcification in CKD rats and VitD3-overloaded mice. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis revealed that BHB downregulated HDAC9, which was further confirmed by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Both pharmacological inhibition and knockdown of HDAC9 attenuated calcification of human VSMCs, while overexpression of HDAC9 exacerbated calcification of VSMCs and aortic rings, indicating that HDAC9 promotes vascular calcification under CKD conditions. Of note, BHB treatment antagonized HDAC9-induced vascular calcification. In addition, HDAC9 overexpression activated the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and inhibition of NF-kappaB attenuated HDAC9-induced VSMC calcification, suggesting that HDAC9 promotes vascular calcification via activation of NF-kappaB. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that BHB supplementation inhibits vascular calcification in CKD via modulation of the HDAC9-dependent NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Moreover, we unveil a crucial mechanistic role of HDAC9 in vascular calcification under CKD conditions; thus, nutritional intervention or pharmacological approaches to enhance BHB levels could act as promising therapeutic strategies to target HDAC9 for the treatment of vascular calcification in CKD.

The glymphatic system based on aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels on the endfeet of astrocytes is recently discovered as the excretion pathway for metabolic waste products of CNS. In the CNS, alpha-syntrophin (SNTA1) directly or indirectly anchors AQP4 in astrocyte membranes facing blood vessels. Studies have indicated that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) can raise the expression of SNTA1 and thus restoring AQP4 polarity in mice models with Alzheimer's disease. The study aims to evaluate the neuroprotective mechanism of BHB in rats with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). PDN rats were modeled under a high-fat and high-glucose diet with a low dose of streptozotocin. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to observe the clearance of contrast to indicate the functional variability of the spinal glymphatic system. Mechanical allodynia was assessed by paw withdrawal threshold. The expressions of SNTA1 and AQP4 were tested, and the polarity reversal of AQP4 protein was measured. As demonstrated, PDN rats were manifested with deceased contrast clearance of the spinal glymphatic system, enhanced mechanical allodynia, lower expression of SNTA1, higher expression of AQP4, and reversed polarity of AQP4 protein. An opposite change in the above characteristics was observed in rats being treated with BHB. This is the first study that demonstrated the neuroprotective mechanism of BHB to attenuate PDN via restoration of the AQP4 polarity in the spinal glymphatic system and provides a promising therapeutic strategy for PDN.",IFNG,individuals with SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS; individuals with influenza-induced ARDS; mice infected with SARS-CoV-2,human; animal,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Animal – Mouse,"OXPHOS fueling, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,lung,Lung,CD4(+) T cells,Unspecified / Mixed,Mixed cell population,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Multi-disease,"mortality, down","Mortality, down",ketogenic diet; ketone ester drink,Ketogenic diet (endogenous); Ketone ester (KE),NS
35902007,Impaired ketogenesis ties metabolism to T cell dysfunction in COVID-19.,"Anorexia and fasting are host adaptations to acute infection, and induce a metabolic switch towards ketogenesis and the production of ketone bodies, including beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)(1-6). However, whether ketogenesis metabolically influences the immune response in pulmonary infections remains unclear. Here we show that the production of BHB is impaired in individuals with SARS-CoV-2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but not in those with influenza-induced ARDS. We found that BHB promotes both the survival of and the production of interferon-gamma by CD4(+) T cells. Applying a metabolic-tracing analysis, we established that BHB provides an alternative carbon source to fuel oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the production of bioenergetic amino acids and glutathione, which is important for maintaining the redox balance. T cells from patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS were exhausted and skewed towards glycolysis, but could be metabolically reprogrammed by BHB to perform OXPHOS, thereby increasing their functionality. Finally, we show in mice that a ketogenic diet and the delivery of BHB as a ketone ester drink restores CD4(+) T cell metabolism and function in severe respiratory infections, ultimately reducing the mortality of mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our data reveal that BHB is an alternative source of carbon that promotes T cell responses in pulmonary viral infections, and highlight impaired ketogenesis as a potential confounding factor in severe COVID-19.",0,LPS-induced sepsis; mice,animal,NS; Animal – Mouse,"inflammation, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Sepsis,Infectious,"organ dysfunction, down","Organ function, down",exogenous ketone ester (KE),Ketone ester (KE),NS
35940076,Exogenous ketone ester administration attenuates systemic inflammation and reduces organ damage in a lipopolysaccharide model of sepsis.,"AIMS: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition of organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated inflammation which predisposes patients to developing cardiovascular disease. The ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate is reported to be cardioprotective in cardiovascular disease and this may be due to their signaling properties that contribute to reducing inflammation. While exogenous ketone esters (KE) increase blood ketone levels, it remains unknown whether KEs can reduce the enhanced inflammatory response and multi-organ dysfunction that is observed in sepsis. Thus, this study assesses whether a recently developed and clinically safe KE can effectively improve the inflammatory response and organ dysfunction in sepsis. METHODS AND RESULTS: To assess the anti-inflammatory effects of a KE, we utilized a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis in which an enhanced inflammatory response results in multi-organ dysfunction. Oral administration of KE for three days prior to LPS-injection significantly protected mice against the profound systemic inflammation compared to their vehicle-treated counterparts. In assessing organ dysfunction, KE protected mice from sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction as well as renal dysfunction and fibrosis. Furthermore, KE administration attenuated the sepsis-induced inflammation in the heart, kidney, and liver. Moreover, these protective effects occurred independent of changes to enzymes involved in ketone metabolism. CONCLUSION: These data show that the use of an exogenous KE attenuates the dysregulated systemic and organ inflammation as well as organ dysfunction in a model of severe inflammation. We postulate that this exogenous KE is an appealing and promising approach to capitalize on the protective anti-inflammatory effects of ketones in sepsis and/or other inflammatory responses.",NLRP3; IL1B; IL18; BAX; CASP3; 0,C57BL/6 male mice; HK-2 cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,kidney,Kidney,proximal tubular epithelial cell (HK-2),Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Acute kidney injury,Renal & Urological,"serum creatinine, nan; blood urea nitrogen, nan; tubular injury, down","Serum creatinine, nan; BUN, nan; Kidney function, down",beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

However, the role of BHB in cisplatin-induced AKI is currently not fully elucidated. In this study, C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into normal control group, cisplatin-induced AKI group and AKI with BHB treatment group. Compared to the control, cisplatin-treated mice exhibited high level of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and severe tubular injury, which accompanied with significantly increased expression level of NLRP3, IL-1beta, IL-18, BAX, cleaved-caspase 3, as well as aggravated oxidative stress and renal tubular cell apoptosis. However, these changes were significantly improved in that of BHB treatment. In vitro, our study showed that the expression of cleaved-caspase3, IL-1beta and IL-18 were significantly increased in human proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) treated with cisplatin compared with the control group, while decreased in cells treated with BHB. Furthermore, a significantly increased expression of cGAS and STING in HK-2 cells treated with cisplatin were found, whereas notably decreased in cells treated with BHB. This data indicates that BHB protects against cisplatin-induced AKI and renal tubular damage mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome and cGAS-STING pathway.",0; FBXO32,10 healthy male volunteers,human,Human – Interventional,"skeletal muscle protein turnover, no-change",Metabolic Regulation,skeletal muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",sodium-BHB,Ketone salt (KS),NS

We aimed to determine any direct effect of BHB on skeletal muscle protein turnover when administered locally in the femoral artery. Paired design with each subject being investigated on one single occasion with one leg being infused with BHB and the opposing leg acting as a control. We studied 10 healthy male volunteers once with bilateral femoral vein and artery catheters. One artery was perfused with saline (Placebo) and one with sodium-BHB. Labelled phenylalanine and palmitate were used to assess local leg fluxes. Femoral vein concentrations of BHB were significantly higher in the intervention leg (3.4 (3.2, 3.6) mM) compared with the placebo-controlled leg (1.9 (1.8, 2.1) mM) with a peak difference of 1.4 (1.1, 1.7) mM, p < 0.0005.

Under these experimental conditions, we failed to observe the direct effects of BHB on skeletal muscle protein turnover. This may relate to a combination of high concentrations of BHB (close to 2 mM) imposed systemically by spillover leading to high BHB concentrations in the saline-infused leg and a lack of major differences in concentration gradients between the two sides-implying that observations were made on the upper part of the dose-response curve for BHB and the relatively small number of subjects studied.",HMGCS2; FGF21; 0,HFD-induced obese mice; surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (osteoarthritis model),animal,Animal – Mouse,"histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Osteoarthritis,Musculoskeletal & Connective Tissue,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketogenic diet (KD),Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

Here, we have studied the effects of administration of a ketogenic diet in mice previously rendered obese by feeding a high fat diet (HFD) and submitted to surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus to mimic osteoarthritis. METHODS: 6-weeks old mice were fed an HFD for 10 weeks and then switched to a chow diet (CD), KD or maintained on a HFD for 8 weeks. Glycemia, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), body weight and fat mass were compared among groups. In liver and kidney, protein expression and histone post-translational modifications were assessed by Western blot, and gene expression by quantitative Real-Time PCR. RESULTS: After a 10 weeks HDF feeding, administration for 8 weeks of a KD or CD induced a comparable weight loss and decrease in fat mass, with better glycemic normalization in the KD group. Histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation, but not histone acetylation, was increased in the liver and kidney of mice fed the KD and the rate-limiting ketogenic enzyme HMGCS2 was upregulated - at the gene and protein level - in liver and, to an even greater extent, in kidney. KD-induced HMGCS2 overexpression may be dependent on FGF21, whose gene expression was increased by KD in liver. CONCLUSIONS: Over a period of 8 weeks, KD is more effective than a chow diet to induce metabolic normalization. Besides acting as a fuel molecule, BHB may exert its metabolic effects through modulation of the epigenome - via histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation - and extensive transcriptional modulation in liver and kidney.",0,fasting healthy participants (anterior cingulate cortex; N=16); fasting healthy participants (posterior cingulate cortex; N=26),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"neurotransmitter levels, down",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,cortex,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Aging,Aging & Frailty,"NS, nan","NS, nan",d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-betaHB) monoester,Multi-source,D-BHB

Beneficial effects of ketones have been reported in the context of protecting the aging brain, however, their neurophysiological effect is still largely uncharacterized, hurdling their development as a valid therapeutic option. In this report, we investigate the neurochemical effect of the acute administration of a ketone d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-betaHB) monoester in fasting healthy participants with ultrahigh-field proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In two within-subject metabolic intervention experiments, 7 T MRS data were obtained in fasting healthy participants (1) in the anterior cingulate cortex pre- and post-administration of D-betaHB (N = 16), and (2) in the posterior cingulate cortex pre- and post-administration of D-betaHB compared to active control glucose (N = 26). Effect of age and blood levels of D-betaHB and glucose were used to further explore the effect of D-betaHB and glucose on MRS metabolites. Results show that levels of GABA and Glu were significantly reduced in the anterior and posterior cortices after administration of D-betaHB. Importantly, the effect was specific to D-betaHB and not observed after administration of glucose. The magnitude of the effect on GABA and Glu was significantly predicted by older age and by elevation of blood levels of D-betaHB. Together, our results show that administration of ketones acutely impacts main inhibitory and excitatory transmitters in the whole fasting cortex, compared to normal energy substrate glucose. Critically, such effects have an increased magnitude in older age, suggesting an increased sensitivity to ketones with brain aging.",0,mouse cerebral cortical slices,animal; in vitro,Multi-model,"competition for oxidative metabolism, no-change",Metabolic Regulation,cerebral cortex,Brain/CNS,astrocytes; neurons,Neural / Glial,Astrocytes; Neurons,cellular compartments,Unspecified / Generic,NS,GLUT1 deficiency syndrome,Genetic / Congenital,"beneficial effect, positive","Quality of life, positive",200 microM [U-(13)C]betaHB,In vitro media supplementation,NS
36045720,beta-Hydroxybutyrate and Medium-Chain Fatty Acids are Metabolized by Different Cell Types in Mouse Cerebral Cortex Slices.,"Ketogenic diets and medium-chain triglycerides are gaining attention as treatment of neurological disorders. Their major metabolites, beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) and the medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) octanoic acid (C8) and decanoic acid (C10), are auxiliary brain fuels. To which extent these fuels compete for metabolism in different brain cell types is unknown. Here, we used acutely isolated mouse cerebral cortical slices to (1) compare metabolism of 200 microM [U-(13)C]C8, [U-(13)C]C10 and [U-(13)C]betaHB and (2) assess potential competition between metabolism of betaHB and MCFAs by quantifying metabolite (13)C enrichment using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The (13)C enrichment in most metabolites was similar with [U-(13)C]C8 and [U-(13)C]C10 as substrates, but several fold lower with [U-(13)C]betaHB. The (13)C enrichment in glutamate was in a similar range for all three substrates, whereas the (13)C enrichments in citrate and glutamine were markedly higher with both [U-(13)C]C8 and [U-(13)C]C10 compared with [U-(13)C]betaHB. As citrate and glutamine are indicators of astrocytic metabolism, the results indicate active MCFA metabolism in astrocytes, while betaHB is metabolized in a different cellular compartment. In competition experiments, (12)C-betaHB altered (13)C incorporation from [U-(13)C]C8 and [U-(13)C]C10 in only a few instances, while (12)C-C8 and (12)C-C10 only further decreased the low [U-(13)C]betaHB-derived (13)C incorporation into citrate and glutamine, signifying little competition for oxidative metabolism between betaHB and the MCFAs. Overall, the data demonstrate that betaHB and MCFAs are supplementary fuels in different cellular compartments in the brain without notable competition. Thus, the use of medium-chain triglycerides in ketogenic diets is likely to be beneficial in conditions with carbon and energy shortages in both astrocytes and neurons, such as GLUT1 deficiency.",FGF21; 0,HepG2 cells; mice,animal; in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line; Animal – Mouse,"HDACs activity inhibition, down",Epigenetic Regulation,hepatocytes,Liver,HepG2 cells,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",intraperitoneal injections of beta-OHB,Intraperitoneal BHB,NS
36077579,beta-Hydroxybutyrate upregulates FGF21 expression through inhibition of histone deacetylases in hepatocytes.,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is secreted by hepatocytes as a peptide hormone to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. FGF21 promotes hepatic ketogenesis and increases ketone body utilization in starvation. Histones are the target molecules of nutrients in regulating hepatic metabolic homeostasis. However, the effect of ketone bodies on FGF21 expression and the involvement of histones in it is not clear yet. The present study observed the effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), the main physiological ketone body, on FGF21 expression in human hepatoma HepG2 cells in vitro and in mice in vivo, and the role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in beta-OHB-regulated FGF21 expression was investigated. The results showed that beta-OHB significantly upregulated FGF21 gene expression and increased FGF21 protein levels while it inhibited HDACs' activity in HepG2 cells. HDACs' inhibition by entinostat upregulated FGF21 expression and eliminated beta-OHB-stimulated FGF21 expression in HepG2 cells. Intraperitoneal injections of beta-OHB in mice resulted in the elevation of serum beta-OHB and the inhibition of hepatic HDACs' activity. Meanwhile, hepatic FGF21 expression and serum FGF21 levels were significantly increased in beta-OHB-treated mice compared with the control. It is suggested that beta-OHB upregulates FGF21 expression through inhibition of HDACs' activity in hepatocytes.",BDNF; MAP1LC3B; ATG14; GJA1,C57BL/6J mice; streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"autophagy, down",Cell Death & Survival,retina,Eye/Retina,microglia,Neural / Glial,Microglia,autophagosome-lysosome formations,Multi-organelle,Multiple,Diabetic retinopathy,Ophthalmologic,"retinal cell safety, up","Cell survival, up",i.p. injections of BHB (25-50-100 mg/kg) twice a week for 10 weeks,Intraperitoneal BHB,NS

Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), previously reported as a protective agent in DR, has been associated with BDNF promotion. Here, we investigated whether systemic BHB affects the retinal levels of BDNF and local autophagy in diabetic mice with retinopathy; Methods: C57BL/6J mice were administered with intraperitoneal (i.p.) streptozotocin (STZ) (75 mg/kg) injection to develop diabetes. After 2 weeks, they received i.p. injections of BHB (25-50-100 mg/kg) twice a week for 10 weeks. Retinal samples were collected in order to perform immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and ELISA analysis; Results: BHB 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg significantly improved retinal BDNF levels (p < 0.01) in diabetic mice. This improvement was negatively associated with autophagosome-lysosome formations (marked by LC3B and ATG14) and to higher levels of connexin 43 (p < 0.01), a marker of cell integrity. Moreover, BHB administration significantly reduced M1 microglial activation and autophagy (p < 0.01); Conclusions: The systemic administration of BHB in mice with DR improves the retinal levels of BDNF, with the consequent reduction of the abnormal microglial autophagy.

RESULTS: Results of this study demonstrated that KD improved neurologic function and reduced apoptotic neurons in cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation mice. With no alteration of glucose uptake, KD suppressed glucose oxidation in mouse brain. Consistently, the glycolytic capacity of the HT22 cells was also downregulated by beta-OHB treatment. Moreover, KD increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate/oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione couples and reduced reactive oxygen species in the brain, probably due to activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of pentose phosphate pathway totally abolished the influence of beta-OHB on glycolysis, and post-oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation cell viability and reactive oxygen species production in HT22 cells. CONCLUSION: KD improved survival and attenuated post-cardiac arrest brain injury, which was mediated by upregulation of pentose phosphate pathway and related antioxidant defense system.",IL2; HCAR2,NS,NS,NS,"GPR109A activation, up",Hormonal Regulation,airway,Upper airway,mast cell,Hematopoietic / Immune,Basophils / Mast cells,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Asthma,Respiratory,"airway inflammation, down","Inflammation, down","ketogenic diet (KD); 1,3-butanediol","Ketogenic diet (endogenous); 1,3-Butanediol (BD)",NS
36237185,The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate mitigates ILC2-driven airway inflammation by regulating mast cell function.,"Ketone bodies are increasingly understood to have regulatory effects on immune cell function, with beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) exerting a predominantly anti-inflammatory response. Dietary strategies to increase endogenous ketone body availability such as the ketogenic diet (KD) have recently been shown to alleviate inflammation of the respiratory tract. However, the role of BHB has not been addressed. Here, we observe that BHB suppresses group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2)-mediated airway inflammation. Central to this are mast cells, which support ILC2 proliferation through interleukin-2 (IL-2). Suppression of the mast cell/IL-2 axis by BHB attenuates ILC2 proliferation and the ensuing type 2 cytokine response and immunopathology. Mechanistically, BHB directly inhibits mast cell function in part through GPR109A activation. Similar effects are achieved with either the KD or 1,3-butanediol. Our data reveal the protective role of BHB in ILC2-driven airway inflammation, which underscores the potential therapeutic value of ketone body supplementation for the management of asthma.",HMGCS2; SLC5A8; OXCT1; SIRT3; 0,ZDF rats; SMCT1 flox/floxCre+ mice; SMCT1 flox/floxCre- mice; HK2 cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"SIRT3/SMCT1 pathway, down",Metabolic Regulation,proximal tubular epithelial cells,Kidney,HK2 cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Tubular damage,Renal & Urological,"cell survival, up","Survival, up",2 mmol/l BHB,Multi-source,NS

METHODS: A high-fat diet-induced hyperinsulinemia model in ZDF rats was used to test the expression of key enzymes/proteins of ketone body metabolism in the kidney. Notably, 12-week-old renal tubule SMCT1 specific knockout mice (SMCT1 flox/floxCre+) and control mice (SMCT1 flox/floxCre-) were used to confirm the roles of SMCT1 in kidney protection under starvation. The changes of key enzymes/proteins of energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, and albumin endocytosis in HK2 cells under low glucose/hypoxic environments with or without 50 ng/mL insulin were studied. Silent information regulation 2 homolog 3 (SIRT3) was overexpressed to evaluate the effect of hyperinsulinemia on the metabolic switch to BHB absorption and utilization through the SIRT3/SMCT1 pathway in HK2 cells. RESULTS: In ZDF rats, the expression of HMGCS2 increased, the SMCT1 expression decreased, while SCOT remained unchanged. In renal tubule SMCT1 gene-specific knockout mice, starvation for 48 h induced an increase in the levels of urine retinol-binding protein, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, and transferrin, which reflected tubular damages. In HK2 cells under an environment of starvation and hypoxia, the levels of key enzymes related to fatty acid oxidation and ketone body metabolism were increased, whereas glucose glycolysis did not change. The addition of 2 mmol/l BHB improved ATP production, mitochondrial biosynthesis, and endocytic albumin function, while cell apoptosis was reduced in HK2 cells. The addition of 50 ng/ml insulin resulted in the decreased expression of SMCT1 along with an impaired mitochondrial function, decreased ATP production, and increased apoptosis. The overexpression of SIRT3 or SMCT1 reversed these alterations induced by a high level of insulin both in low-glucose and hypoxic environments. CONCLUSIONS: The increased absorption and utilization of BHB is part of the metabolic flexibility of renal tubular epithelial cells under starvation and hypoxic environments, which exhibits a protective effect on renal tubular epithelial cells by improving the mitochondrial function and cell survival. Moreover, hyperinsulinemia inhibits the absorption of BHB through the inhibition of the SIRT3/SMCT1 pathway.",0,8 healthy men,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"suppression of lipolysis, down",Metabolic Regulation,skeletal muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"insulin sensitivity, up","Insulin sensitivity, up",infusion,NS,NS

OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that administration of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) acutely increases insulin sensitivity via feedback suppression of circulating free fatty acid (FFA) levels. METHODS: In a randomized, single-blinded crossover design, 8 healthy men were studied twice with a growth hormone (GH) infusion to induce lipolysis in combination with infusion of either betaOHB or saline. Each study day comprised a basal period and a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp combined with a glucose tracer and adipose tissue and skeletal muscle biopsies. RESULTS: betaOHB administration profoundly suppressed FFA levels concomitantly with a significant increase in glucose disposal and energy expenditure. This was accompanied by a many-fold increase in skeletal muscle content of both betaOHB and its derivative acetoacetate. CONCLUSION: Our data unravel an insulin-sensitizing effect of betaOHB, which we suggest is mediated by concomitant suppression of lipolysis.",LEP,overweight and obese adults; KD + KS (n = 12); KD + PL (n = 13); LFD (n = 12),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,serum,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"depression, down; anger, down; math processing performance, up; go/no-go performance, up","Depressive-like behavior, down; Anxiety-like behavior, down; Cognitive performance, up",exogenous ketone salt (KS),Ketone salt (KS),NS

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of an exogenous ketone salt (KS) as part of a hypocaloric KD on mood and cognitive outcomes in overweight and obese adults. A secondary objective was to evaluate changes in biochemical markers associated with inflammatory and cognitive responses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults who were overweight or obese participated in a 6-week controlled-feeding intervention comparing hypocaloric diets ( approximately 75% of energy expenditure). KD groups received twice daily ketone salt (KD + KS; n = 12) or a flavor-matched placebo, free of minerals (KD + PL; n = 13). A separate group of age and BMI matched adults were later assigned to an isoenergetic low-fat diet (LFD; n = 12) as comparison to KD. Mood was assessed by shortened Profile of Mood States and Visual Analog Mood Scale surveys. Cognitive function was determined by the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics mental test battery. RESULTS: Both KD groups achieved nutritional ketosis. Fasting serum glucose decreased in both KD groups, whereas glucose was unaffected in the LFD. Insulin decreased at week 2 and remained lower in all groups. At week 2, depression scores in the KD + PL group were higher compared to KD + KS. Performance in the math processing and go/no-go cognitive tests were lower for KD + PL and LFD participants, respectively, compared to KD + KS. Serum leptin levels decreased for all groups throughout the study but were higher for KD + KS group at week 6. Serum TNF-alpha steadily increased for LFD participants, reaching significance at week 6. CONCLUSION: During a short-term hypocaloric diet, no indication of a consistent decline in mood or cognitive function were seen in participants following either KD, despite KD + PL being relatively low in sodium.

Our aim was to investigate whether ketone salt supplementation can improve PTSD symptoms in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: A total of 21 participants were recruited and randomized to placebo or ketone supplement. Each dose of ketone supplement included 7 g of ketones in the form of beta-hydroxybutyrate for a total of 14 g/d. Data were collected through questionnaires to assess PTSD symptoms. We used Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and 2-sample t tests for continuous variables to examine differences in baseline values between treatment groups. Mixed models were employed to examine changes over time between groups on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in PCL-5 medians between the ketone and control groups at pretest (P = 1.0000) or post-test (P = .6020). The ketone group had a statistically significant decrease in median PCL-5 scores from 58.5 (pretest) to 54.0 (posttest; P = .0003) but the control group did not change (34 at pretest and at posttest; P = .4418). CONCLUSIONS: The ketone group showed a significant decrease in PCL-5 score at posttest compared with pretest that was not seen in the control group, although these changes were not statistically significant between groups.

DESIGN: Pronucleate mouse oocytes were cultured in vitro in G1/G2 media supplemented with ketones (AcAc or AcAc + betaOHB) at concentrations representing those in maternal serum during pregnancy (0.04 mmol/l AcAc, 0.1 mmol/l betaOHB), standard diet consumption (0.1 mmol/l AcAc, 0.25 mmol/l betaOHB), ketogenic diet consumption (0.8 mmol/l AcAc, 2 mmol/l betaOHB) and diabetic ketoacidosis (2 mmol/l AcAc, 4 mmol/l betaOHB). Day 5 blastocysts were assessed for cell allocation, glucose metabolism and histone acetylation. Day 4 blastocysts exposed to 0.8 mmol/l AcAc + 2 mmol/l betaOHB were transferred to standard-fed recipient females, and E14.5 fetal and placental development assessed. RESULTS: Exposure to 2 mmol/l AcAc or 0.8 mmol/l AcAc + 2 mmol/l betaOHB did not impair blastocyst development, but significantly increased glucose consumption (P = 0.001 each), lowered glycolytic flux (P = 0.01, P < 0.001) and elevated trophectoderm (TE) histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac; P < 0.001 each) compared with unexposed controls.

In this study, we compared the effects of two commercial betaOHB formulations an enantiomer R betaOHB and a racemic mixture +/-betaOHB on induced pluripotent stem cell cardiac myocytes (iPS-CMs) electrophysiology. Cardiac myocytes were cultured in R betaOHB or +/-betaOHB for at least ten days after lactate selection. Flouvolt or Fluo-4 was used to assay iPS-CMs electrophysiology. We found that while both formulations increased the optical potential amplitude, R betaOHB prolonged the action potential duration but +/-betaOHB shortened the action potential duration. Moreover, +/-betaOHB increased the peak calcium transient but R betaOHB reduced the peak calcium transient. Co-culturing with glucose or fatty acids did not ameliorate the effects, suggesting that betaOHB was more than a fuel source. The effect of betaOHB on iPS-CMs electrophysiology is most likely stereoselective, and care must be taken to evaluate the role of exogenous betaOHB in health and disease.",HCAR2; TGFB1; CXCL2; TLR2; IL10; IL1B,RAW 264.7 (mouse macrophages),in vitro,Multi-model,"Gpr109a expression, up",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,RAW 264.7 macrophages,Hematopoietic / Immune,Macrophages,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Mastitis,Infectious,"macrophage inflammatory response, altered","Inflammation, altered","BHB (0, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mM) in medium",In vitro media supplementation,NS

Recent mouse studies have elucidated an anti-inflammatory effect of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether BHB altered inflammatory responses in macrophages challenged with the common mastitis pathogen Streptococcus uberis. A secondary objective was to determine whether the inflammatory response to the S. uberis challenge was dependent on whether BHB was present in the medium during the challenge (i.e., preconditioned vs. continuous treatment). Two cell culture experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7 line) were preconditioned with BHB (0, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mM) for 24 h; the medium was then replaced with a standard cell culture medium, and the cells were challenged or not with S. uberis for an additional 6 h. In the second experiment, a similar protocol was used; however, cells were preconditioned with BHB (0, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mM) for 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the same concentration of BHB, and cells were either challenged or not with S. uberis for 6 h. In both experiments, relative transcript abundance of cell membrane receptors (Tlr2 and Gpr109a), cytokines (Il1b, Il10, Tnf, and Tgfb1), and chemokines (Cxcl2 and Ccl5) were determined using quantitative real-time PCR and normalized against the geometric mean of Hprt and B2m. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model, and orthogonal contrasts were conducted to examine the effect of S. uberis challenge and BHB treatment. Streptococcus uberis activated the macrophages, noted by greater transcript abundance of analyzed genes. Intriguingly, in both experiments, the S. uberis challenge increased expression of Gpr109a, which encodes a receptor that is ligated by BHB. Paradoxically, preconditioning macrophages with BHB increased transcript abundance of the immunosuppressive cytokine Tgfb1 and increased that of the neutrophil chemoattractant Cxcl2. Preconditioning decreased Tlr2 and tended to decrease Il10 transcript abundance. In opposition to the preconditioning experiment, continuous treatment of BHB during the S. uberis challenge linearly increased abundance of Tlr2 and Il10 transcripts. Continuous BHB treatment also increased expression of Il1b. In conclusion, BHB treatment altered macrophage inflammatory responses during an S. uberis challenge; however, the direction of this response was dependent on whether BHB was added to the medium during the S. uberis challenge. Future studies should be conducted using bovine macrophages and in vivo approaches to examine BHB effects during an S. uberis challenge.",0; CD36,rodent cardiomyocytes; human cardiomyocytes,animal; human; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells,"v-ATPase disassembly, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,heart,Heart,cardiomyocytes,Muscle – Cardiac,Cardiomyocytes,endosomes,Endosome System,Unspecified,Insulin resistance,Metabolic & Endocrine,"cardiac function, down","Cardiac function, down",3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (3HB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
36423429,Ketone Body Exposure of Cardiomyocytes Impairs Insulin Sensitivity and Contractile Function through Vacuolar-Type H(+)-ATPase Disassembly-Rescue by Specific Amino Acid Supplementation.,"The heart is metabolically flexible. Under physiological conditions, it mainly uses lipids and glucose as energy substrates. In uncontrolled diabetes, the heart switches towards predominant lipid utilization, which over time is detrimental to cardiac function. Additionally, diabetes is accompanied by high plasma ketone levels and increased utilization of energy provision. The administration of exogenous ketones is currently being investigated for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Yet, it remains unclear whether increased cardiac ketone utilization is beneficial or detrimental to cardiac functioning. The mechanism of lipid-induced cardiac dysfunction includes disassembly of the endosomal proton pump (named vacuolar-type H+-ATPase; v-ATPase) as the main early onset event, followed by endosomal de-acidification/dysfunction. The de-acidified endosomes can no longer serve as a storage compartment for lipid transporter CD36, which then translocates to the sarcolemma to induce lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, and contractile dysfunction. Lipid-induced v-ATPase disassembly is counteracted by the supply of specific amino acids. Here, we tested the effect of ketone bodies on v-ATPase assembly status and regulation of lipid uptake in rodent/human cardiomyocytes. 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) exposure induced v-ATPase disassembly and the entire cascade of events leading to contractile dysfunction and insulin resistance, similar to conditions of lipid oversupply. Acetoacetate addition did not induce v-ATPase dysfunction. The negative effects of 3HB could be prevented by addition of specific amino acids. Hence, in sedentary/prediabetic subjects ketone bodies should be used with caution because of possible aggravation of cardiac insulin resistance and further loss of cardiac function. When these latter maladaptive conditions would occur, specific amino acids could potentially be a treatment option.",STAT3; NLRP3; GSDMD; IL1B; IL18,MPTP-induced mice; MPP(+)-simulated BV2 cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"STAT3-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,NS,NS,microglia,Neural / Glial,Microglia,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Parkinson's disease,Neurodegenerative,"motor function, up; dopaminergic neuron loss, down; glial cell activation, down; IL-1beta and IL-18 levels, down","Motor function, up; Neuronal survival, down; Neuroinflammation, down; Cytokine level, down",BHB supplement,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Growing evidence implies beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB), one of the ketone bodies generated by ketogenesis, plays a neuroprotective role in neurodegenerative diseases. We aimed to verify the anti-inflammatory effect of BHB on PD and further explore potential molecular mechanisms. METHODS: We performed the experiments on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mice model in vivo and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-simulated BV2 cell model in vitro, with or without BHB pretreatment. Motor function was assessed by pole test, forced swimming test, traction test and open field test. Immunofluorescence was used to evaluate the loss of dopaminergic neurons and glial cell activation in MPTP-induced PD model mice. The expression of the STAT3/NLRP3/GSDMD signal pathway was measured by western blots. Proinflammatory cytokines was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: BHB treatment reversed motor deficits, loss of dopaminergic neurons and glial cell activation in PD mice induced by MPTP. Moreover, BHB inhibited microglia pyroptosis by negatively regulating STAT3/NLRP3/GSDMD signal pathway, resulting in downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and IL-18) in vivo and vitro. CONCLUSION: These data suggested BHB supplement inhibited pyroptosis by down-regulating STAT3-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation for PD models in vivo and in vitro.

Whereas, its exact regulatory roles and mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD) have not been full elucidated. In this study, SN4741 cells and C57BL/6 mice were treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+))/1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to establish the PD model in vitro and in vivo. Cell viability and damage to dopaminergic neurons were measured by cell counting kit 8, Calcein-AM/PI staining, terminal dexynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and hematoxylin & eosin staining. Corresponding assay kits and BODIPY 581/591 C11 probe evaluated oxidative stress and intracellular iron levels. Western blot examined the ferroptosis-related proteins. MPTP/MPP(+)-treatment reduced cell viability but triggered oxidative stress and ferroptosis in SNA4741 cells and brain tissues of mice. However, these effects were dramatically reversed by BHB and Fer-1 treatment. Mechanistically, Zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36) was a target of BHB, and its depletion could reverse the anti-oxidative stress and anti-ferroptosis roles of BHB. Moreover, ZFP36 could directly bound to acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) mRNA to decay its expression, thus negatively modulating ACSL4-mediated oxidative stress and ferroptosis.

We have previously reported that mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-COA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) is involved in AD by promoting autophagic clearance of amyloid-beta protein precursor via ketone body-associated mechanism, whether HMGCS2 may also regulate Tau metabolism remains elusive. OBJECTIVE: The present study was to investigate the role of HMGCS2 in Tau/p degradation. METHODS: The protein levels of Tau and pTau including pT217 and pT181, as well as autophagic markers LAMP1 and LC3-II were assessed by western blotting. The differentially regulated genes by HMGCS2 were analyzed by RNA sequencing. Autophagosomes were assessed by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: HMGCS2 significantly decreased Tau/pTau levels, which was paralleled by enhanced formation of autophagic vacuoles and prevented by autophagic regulators chloroquine, bafilomycin A1, 3-methyladenine, and rapamycin. Moreover, HMGCS2-induced alterations of LAMP1/LC3-II and Tau/pTau levels were mimicked by ketone body acetoacetate or beta-hydroxybutyrate. Further RNA-sequencing identified ankyrin repeat domain 24 (ANKRD24) as a target gene of HMGCS2, and silencing of ANKRD24 reduced LAMP1/LC3-II levels, which was accompanied by the altered formation of autophagic vacuoles, and diminished the effect of HMGCS2 on Tau/pTau. CONCLUSION: HMGCS2 promoted autophagic clearance of Tau/pTau, in which ketone body and ANKRD24 played an important role.",EPO,nine healthy men,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate,Ketone ester (KE),D-BHB

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of ketone monoester ingestion on postexercise erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations. Nine healthy men completed two trials in a randomized, crossover design (1-wk washout). During trials, participants performed 1 h of cycling (initially alternating between 50% and 90% of maximal aerobic capacity for 2 min each interval, and then 50% and 80%, and 50% and 70% when the higher intensity was unsustainable). Participants ingested 0.8 g.kg(-1) sucrose with 0.4 g.kg(-1) protein immediately after exercise, and at 1, 2, and 3 h postexercise. During the control trial (CONTROL), no further nutrition was provided, whereas on the ketone monoester trial (KETONE), participants also ingested 0.29 g.kg(-1) of the ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate immediately postexercise and at 1 and 2 h postexercise. Blood was sampled immediately postexercise, every 15 min in the first hour and hourly thereafter for 4 h. Serum EPO concentrations increased to a greater extent in KETONE than in CONTROL (time x condition interaction: P = 0.046). Peak serum EPO concentrations were higher with KETONE (means +/- SD: 9.0 +/- 2.3 IU.L(-1)) compared with CONTROL (7.5 +/- 1.5 IU.L(-1), P < 0.01). Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were also higher, and glucose concentrations lower, with KETONE versus CONTROL (both P < 0.01). In conclusion, ketone monoester ingestion increases postexercise erythropoietin concentrations, revealing a new avenue for orally ingestible ketone monoesters to potentially alter hemoglobin mass.NEW & NOTEWORTHY To our knowledge, this study was the first to assess the effects of ketone monoester ingestion on erythropoietin concentrations after exercise.

This study aims to investigate whether KD consumption possesses therapeutic potential for cocaine reinstatement and the molecular mechanism. We find that a KD significantly reduces cocaine-induced reinstatement in mice, which is accompanied by a markedly elevated level of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), the most abundant ketone body, in the hippocampus. The underlying mechanism is that beta-OHB posttranslationally modifies CaMKII-alpha with beta-hydroxybutyrylation, resulting in significant inhibition of T286 autophosphorylation and downregulation of CaMKII activity. Collectively, our results reveal that beta-hydroxybutyrylation is a posttranslational modification of CaMKII-alpha that plays a critical role in mediating the effect of KD consumption in reducing cocaine reinstatement.",0; CXCL8,mouse macrophages; mouse airway epithelial cells; human airway epithelial cells; polyclonally and HDM-activated T cells; bronchial smooth muscle cells; acute HDM sensitization and challenge mouse models; HDM rechallenge chronic model; HDM-driven mixed-granulocytic severe asthma model,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells; Multi-model; Animal – Other Mammal,"anti-inflammatory activity, up",Inflammation & Immune Response,lung,Lung,airway epithelial cells,Epithelial – Respiratory,Airway/bronchial epithelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Asthma,Respiratory,"methacholine hyperresponsiveness, down","Airway hyperresponsiveness, down",ketogenic diet; ketone precursor; ketone ester dietary supplement,Ketogenic diet (endogenous); NS; Ketone ester (KE),NS

There remains a need for alternatives or complements to existing treatments that could control the physiologic manifestations of allergic asthma. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to examine the hypothesis that because ketone bodies elicit anti-inflammatory activity and are effective in mitigating the methacholine hyperresponsiveness associated with obese asthma, increasing systemic concentrations of ketone bodies would diminish pathologic outcomes in asthma-relevant cell types and in mouse models of allergic asthma. METHODS: We explored the effects of ketone bodies on allergic asthma-relevant cell types (macrophages, airway epithelial cells, CD4 T cells, and bronchial smooth muscle cells) in vitro as well as in vivo by using preclinical models representative of several endotypes of allergic asthma to determine whether promotion of ketosis through feeding a ketogenic diet or providing a ketone precursor or a ketone ester dietary supplement could affect immune and inflammatory parameters as well as methacholine hyperresponsiveness. RESULTS: In a dose-dependent manner, the ketone bodies acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) decreased proinflammatory cytokine secretion from mouse macrophages and airway epithelial cells, decreased house dust mite (HDM) extract-induced IL-8 secretion from human airway epithelial cells, and decreased cytokine production from polyclonally and HDM-activated T cells. Feeding a ketogenic diet, providing a ketone body precursor, or supplementing the diet with a ketone ester increased serum BHB concentrations and decreased methacholine hyperresponsiveness in several acute HDM sensitization and challenge models of allergic asthma. A ketogenic diet or ketone ester supplementation decreased methacholine hyperresponsiveness in an HDM rechallenge model of chronic allergic asthma. Ketone ester supplementation synergized with corticosteroid treatment to decrease methacholine hyperresponsiveness in an HDM-driven model of mixed-granulocytic severe asthma. HDM-induced morphologic changes in bronchial smooth muscle cells were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by BHB, as was HDM protease activity. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing systemic BHB concentrations through dietary interventions could provide symptom relief for several endotypes of allergic asthmatic individuals through effects on multiple asthma-relevant cells.",0,SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell; primary neuron; primary astrocyte,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line; In vitro – Primary cells,"neuron respiration, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,brain,Brain/CNS,SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Aging; neurodegenerative diseases,Aging & Frailty; Neurodegenerative,"cell senescence, down","Cell senescence, down",NS,NS,NS

Here, we characterized how SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell, primary neuron, and primary astrocyte bioenergetics and nutrient sensing pathways respond to beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB). SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons, but not astrocytes, exposed to betaOHB increased respiration and decreased PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling. Despite increased carbon availability and respiration, SH-SY5Y cells treated with betaOHB reduced their overall metabolic activity and cell cycling rate. Levels of the quiescence-regulating Yamanaka factors increased to a broader extent in SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons. We propose a betaOHB-induced increase in neuron respiration, accompanied by activation of quiescence associated pathways, could alleviate bioenergetic stress and limit cell senescence. This in turn could potentially benefit conditions, including brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases, that feature bioenergetic decline and cell senescence.",0,52 patients (possible cardiac sarcoidosis or suspected intracardiac infection) following ketogenic diet and prolonged fasting,human,Multi-model,"ketonaemia-mediated SUVbw reduction, down",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketogenic diet and prolonged fasting,Multi-source,NS

This study aimed to investigate the effect of ketosis on cerebral glucose metabolism in a clinical PET scanning environment using (18)F-FDG uptake as a surrogate marker. METHODS: A retrospective audit was conducted of the brain (18)F-FDG uptake in 52 patients who underwent PET scans for possible cardiac sarcoidosis or suspected intracardiac infection, following a ketogenic diet and prolonged fasting. SUVbw for whole brain and separate brain regions was compared with serum glucose and serum ketone body (beta-hydroxybutyrate) levels. RESULTS: The expected negative association between serum glucose levels and whole brain (18)F-FDG uptake was confirmed. A reduction in SUVbw due to increasing serum ketones levels was also observed that was independent of and in addition to the effects of glucose. The magnitude of the reduction in SUVbw related to serum glucose level and serum ketone level was found to be greater in the precuneus than in the cerebellum or whole brain. CONCLUSION: In a real-world clinical PET setting, cerebral (18)F-FDG uptake appears to be affected by glycaemia and ketonaemia. This means when assessing the brain, both serum glucose and ketone levels need to be considered when SUVs are used to distinguish between pathologic and physiologic states. The magnitude of this effect appears to vary between different brain regions. This regional difference should be taken into consideration when selecting the appropriate brain region for SUV normalisation, particularly when undertaking database comparison in the assessment of dementia.",BDNF; SLC16A1; APC; HDAC3; PARP1; AIFM1; TRPA1; NTRK2; DCX; RBFOX3; PDGFRA; SOX2; GFAP; TRAP1; OLIG2; MAPK14; MAPK8; JUN; 0,continuous 35 days CPZ mouse model,animal,Animal – Mouse,"down-regulation of TRPA1 and PARP, down",Multiple mechanisms,corpus callosum,Brain/CNS,oligodendrocyte,Neural / Glial,Oligodendrocytes / OPCs,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Multiple sclerosis,Autoimmune & Inflammatory,"myelin loss, down","Myelination, down",exogenous BHB,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Aging is the most significant risk factor for the progression of MS. Dietary modulation (such as ketogenic diet) and caloric restriction, can increase ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Increased BHB has been reported to prevent or improve age-related disease. The present studies were performed to understand the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of exogenous BHB in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model. In this study, a continuous 35 days CPZ mouse model with or without BHB was established. The changes of behavior function, pathological hallmarks of CPZ, and intracellular signal pathways in mice were detected by Open feld test, Morris water maze, RT-PCR, immuno-histochemistry, and western blot. The results showed that BHB treatment improved behavioral performance, prevented myelin loss, decreased the activation of astrocyte as well as microglia, and up-regulated the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in both the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Meanwhile, BHB treatment increased the number of MCT1(+) cells and APC(+) oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the treatment decreased the expression of HDAC3, PARP1, AIF and TRPA1 which is related to oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis in the corpus callosum, accompanied by increased expression of TrkB. This leads to an increased density of doublecortin (DCX)(+) neuronal precursor cells and mature NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the hippocampus. As a result, BHB treatment effectively promotes the generation of PDGF-Ra(+) (oligodendrocyte precursor cells, OPCs), Sox2(+) cells and GFAP(+) (astrocytes), and decreased the production of GFAP(+) TRAP1(+) cells, and Oligo2(+) TRAP1(+) cells in the corpus callosum of mouse brain. Thus, our results demonstrate that BHB treatment efficiently supports OPC differentiation and decreases the OLs apoptosis in CPZ-intoxicated mice, partly by down-regulating the expression of TRPA1 and PARP, which is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/JNK/JUN pathway and the activation of ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, supporting BHB treatment adjunctive nutritional therapy for the treatment of chronic demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS).",AIFM2,"1,264 clinical cases of liver failure; major-liver-resection-induced ALF mouse",human; animal,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Animal – Mouse,"H3K9bhb-mediated chromatin opening, up",Epigenetic Regulation,pancreas,Pancreas,pancreatic cells,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Pancreatitis,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"ferroptosis, down","Cell survival, down",beta-HB administration in ALF mice,NS,NS

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study describes pancreatic tissue damage and exocrine dysfunction in a mouse model of major-liver-resection-induced ALF. The analysis of 1,264 clinical cases of liver failure (LF) showed that the incidence of hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia in patients with LF is 5.5% and 20%, respectively. Metabolomic studies indicate that glutathione (GSH)-deficiency-caused ferroptosis contributes to pancreatic damage in mouse ALF. beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) is the only metabolite downregulated in the liver, serum, and pancreas. Our data suggest that beta-HB protects pancreatic cells and tissues from GSH-deficiency-caused ferroptosis. beta-HB administration in ALF mice restores the expression of ferroptosis-suppressor genes through histone H3 lysine 9 beta-hydroxybutyrylation (H3K9bhb)-mediated chromatin opening.

Whether white adipose tissue plays a role in effects of acute nutritional ketosis is largely unknown. Objective: To investigate the effects of acute nutritional ketosis on plasma levels of asprosin and leptin and if they are affected by abdominal fat phenotypes. Methods: The design was a randomised crossover trial. Participants received either the D-beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol monoester (KEbetaHB) drink or placebo drink. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes. 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure visceral and subcutaneous fat volumes (VFV and SFV, respectively), intra-hepatic fat deposition (IHFD), and intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD). Results: A total of 18 adults were randomised, with no drop-outs. There were no significant differences in plasma levels of asprosin and leptin (p = 0.808 and p = 0.907, respectively) between the KEbetaHB and placebo drinks. There was no effect of time, treatment, or interaction between time and treatment on asprosin and leptin. After stratification by the VFV/SFV ratio, IHFD, and IPFD, there were no differences in asprosin and leptin between the KEbetaHB and placebo drinks. Conclusion: Plasma levels of asprosin and leptin were not significantly affected by acute nutritional ketosis. Abdominal fat phenotypes did not significantly affect circulating levels of the two hormones.

The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) can be a signaling molecule regulating gene transcription. Thus, we assessed lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (K-bhb) levels in proteins extracted from the cerebral cortex of mice undergoing a ketogenic metabolic challenge (48 h fasting). We found that fasting enhanced K-bhb in a variety of proteins including histone H3. ChIP-seq experiments showed that K9 beta-hydroxybutyrylation of H3 (H3K9-bhb) was significantly enriched by fasting on more than 8000 DNA loci. Transcriptomic analysis showed that H3K9-bhb on enhancers and promoters correlated with active gene expression. One of the most enriched functional annotations both at the epigenetic and transcriptional level was ""circadian rhythms''. Indeed, we found that the diurnal oscillation of specific transcripts was modulated by fasting at distinct zeitgeber times both in the cortex and suprachiasmatic nucleus. Moreover, specific changes in locomotor activity daily features were observed during re-feeding after 48-h fasting. Thus, our results suggest that fasting remarkably impinges on the cerebral cortex transcriptional and epigenetic landscape, and BHB acts as a powerful epigenetic molecule in the brain through direct and specific histone marks remodeling in neural tissue cells.",0,C57BL/6 mice; DHEA-induced PCOS mice; KGN cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"inflammation and cell apoptosis inhibition, down",Cell Death & Survival,ovaries,Ovary,KGN cells,Unspecified / Mixed,Cell line (origin unclear),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Polycystic ovary syndrome,Reproductive & Pregnancy,"ovarian functions, up","Ovarian function, up",NS,NS,NS

The ketogenic diet (KD) is a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrate. The beneficial effects of KD intervention have been demonstrated in obese women with PCOS. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a KD on both reproductive and metabolic phenotypes of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS mice. Female C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups, designated Control, DHEA, and DHEA+KD groups. Mice of both Control and DHEA groups were fed the control diet, whereas DHEA+KD mice were fed a KD with 89%(kcal) fat for 1 or 3 weeks after PCOS mouse model was completed. At the end of the experiment, both reproductive and metabolic characteristics were assessed. Our data show that KD treatment significantly increased blood ketone levels, reduced body weight and random and fasting blood glucose levels in DHEA+KD mice compared with DHEA mice. Glucose tolerance, however, was impaired in DHEA+KD mice. Ovarian functions were improved in some DHEAmice after KD feeding, especially in mice treated with KD for 3 weeks. In addition, inflammation and cell apoptosis were inhibited in the ovaries of DHEA+KD mice. Results from in vitro experiments showed that the main ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate reduced inflammation and cell apoptosis in DHEA-treated KGN cells. These findings support the therapeutic effects of KD and reveal a possible mechanism by which KD improves ovarian functions in PCOS mice.",FOXO1,clinical patients; diabetic rats; HG-stimulated HCMECs,human; animal; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells,"FoxO1 generation, down","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",cardiac microvasculature,Vasculature,cardiac microvascular endothelial cells,Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"endothelial injury, down","Endothelial function, down",D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

However, it is unknown whether D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) regulates cardiac microvascular endothelial FoxO1 to play protective roles in diabetes. In the study, limb microvascular morphological changes, endothelial distribution of the tight junction protein Claudin-5 and FoxO1, and FoxO1 content in limb tissue from clinical patients were evaluated. Then the effects of BHB on cardiac microvascular morphological changes, cardiac FoxO1 generation and its microvascular distribution in diabetic rats were measured. And the effects of BHB on FoxO1 generation in high glucose (HG)-stimulated human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs) were further analyzed. The results firstly confirmed the enhanced limb microvascular FoxO1 distribution, with reduced Claudin-5 and endothelial injury in clinical patients. Then the elevated FoxO1 generation and its enhanced cardiac microvascular distribution were verified in diabetic rats and HG-stimulated HCMECs. However, BHB inhibited the enhanced cardiac FoxO1 generation and its microvascular distribution with attenuation of endothelial injury in diabetic rats. Furthermore, BHB reduced the HG-stimulated mRNA expression and protein content of FoxO1 in HCMECs.

36734124,A High-Fat Diet in the Absence of Obesity Increases Lymphangiogenesis by Inducing VEGF-C in a Murine Lymphedema Model.,"BACKGROUND: Many researchers have attempted to induce lymphangiogenesis for the treatment of lymphedema. However, most previous studies had limited clinical usefulness. A high-fat diet (HFD) increases serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) levels, which can stimulate lymphangiogenesis. The authors hypothesized that an HFD will ameliorate lymphedema through enhanced lymphangiogenesis. METHODS: The effects of beta-OHB on the lymphangiogenic process in human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells were analyzed. A mouse tail lymphedema model was used to evaluate the effects of an HFD on lymphedema. Experimental mice were fed an HFD (45% kcal as fat, 20% as protein, and 35% as carbohydrates) for 4 weeks. Tail volume was measured using the truncated cone formula. Biopsy specimens were taken 6 weeks after surgical induction of lymphedema. RESULTS: In human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells, treatment with 20 mM of beta-OHB increased cell viability ( P = 0.008), cell migration ( P = 0.011), tube formation ( P = 0.005), and VEGF-C mRNA and protein expression ( P < 0.001) compared with controls. HFD feeding decreased tail volume by 14.3% and fibrosis by 15.8% ( P = 0.027), and increased the lymphatic vessel density ( P = 0.022) and VEGF-C protein expression ( P = 0.005) compared with those of operated, standard chow diet-fed mice. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings demonstrated that beta-OHB promoted lymphatic endothelial cell function and increased VEGF-C mRNA and protein expression. When mice with tail lymphedema were fed an HFD, volume and fibrosis of the tail decreased. Therefore, the authors' findings suggest that an HFD can be a successful novel dietary approach to treating lymphedema.

In particular, psychological trait-like construct related to eating has been shown to be an important target for intervention. Methods and measures: This study aimed to investigate the biochemical variables associated with a decrease in emotional and external eating behaviors due to 12-week ketogenic diet (12KD) in 35 adult participants (12 males) with obesity. Results: Absolute changes in emotional and external eating were independent of changes in body mass, nutritional intake, and Delta cortisol, but were predicted with increases in serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and decreases in serum peripheral neuropeptide Y (pNPY) (all p's < 0.050). Decrease in pNPY was also associated with an increase in BHB but was independent of anthropometrical changes, Delta fasting glucose, and Delta insulin. Conclusion: The reductions in emotional and external eating behaviors in participants with obesity were uniquely predicted by an increase in BHB and a decrease in pNPY after 12KD. In ketosis, emotional and external eating dropped independently of body mass change. Change in pNPY predicted changes in emotional and external eating.

Thus, we investigated whether administration of EKSs can modulate the isoflurane anesthesia-generated increase in blood glucose level and the time required to recover from isoflurane-induced anesthesia. METHODS: To investigate the effect of EKSs on isoflurane anesthesia-induced changes in blood glucose and R-beta-hydroxybutyrate (R-betaHB) level as well as recovery time from anesthesia, we used KEMCT (mix of ketone ester/KE and medium chain triglyceride/MCT oil in a 1:1 ratio) in WAG/Rij rats. First, to accustom the animals to the method, water gavage was carried out for 5 days (adaptation period). After adaptation period, rats of first group (group 1) were gavaged by water (3 g/kg), whereas, in the case of second group (group 2), the diet of animals was supplemented by KEMCT (3 g/kg, gavage) once per day for 7 days. One hour after the last gavage, isoflurane (3%) anesthesia was induced for 20 min (group 1 and group 2) and the time required for recovery from anesthesia was measured by using righting reflex. Subsequently, blood levels of both R-betaHB and glucose were also evaluated. Changes in blood glucose and R-betaHB levels were compared to control, which control glucose and R-betaHB levels were measured on the last day of the adaptation period (group 1 and group 2). Time required for recovery from isoflurane anesthesia, which was detected after 7(th) KEMCT gavage (group 2), was compared to recovery time measured after 7(th) water gavage (group 1). RESULTS: The KEMCT maintained the normal glucose level under isoflurane anesthesia-evoked circumstances preventing the glucose level elevating effect of isoflurane. Thus, we demonstrated that administration of KEMCT not only increased blood level of R-betaHB but also abolished the isoflurane anesthesia-generated increase in blood glucose level. Moreover, the time required for recovery from isoflurane-evoked anesthesia increased significantly in KEMCT treated animals.

The ketone body, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB), is metabolized to acetyl-CoA in brain mitochondria and used as an energy fuel alternative to glucose. We have previously reported that D-BHB sustains ATP production and stimulates the autophagic flux under glucose deprivation in neurons; however, the effects of D-BHB on mitochondrial turnover under physiological conditions are still unknown. Sirtuins (SIRTs) are NAD(+)-activated protein deacetylases involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy through the activation of transcription factors FOXO1, FOXO3a, TFEB and PGC1alpha coactivator. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of D-BHB on mitochondrial turnover in cultured neurons and the mechanisms involved. Results show that D-BHB increased mitochondrial membrane potential and regulated the NAD(+)/NADH ratio. D-BHB enhanced FOXO1, FOXO3a and PGC1alpha nuclear levels in an SIRT2-dependent manner and stimulated autophagy, mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. These effects increased neuronal resistance to energy stress. D-BHB also stimulated the autophagic-lysosomal pathway through AMPK activation and TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis. Upregulation of SIRT2, FOXOs, PGC1alpha and TFEB was confirmed in the brain of ketogenic diet (KD)-treated mice. Altogether, the results identify SIRT2, for the first time, as a target of D-BHB in neurons, which is involved in the regulation of autophagy/mitophagy and mitochondrial quality control.",NLRP3,aging mouse models; liver HMGCL-deficient mice; neutrophil HMGCL-deficient mice; macrophage HMGCL-deficient mice; myeloid cell-specific Hmgcl-deficient mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,liver,Liver,myeloid cells,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Age-related inflammation,Aging & Frailty,"healthspan, up","Lifespan, up",liver-derived circulating ketone bodies,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
36790381,Innate immune cell-intrinsic ketogenesis is dispensable for organismal metabolism and age-related inflammation.,"Aging is accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammation, but the mechanisms that allow this to persist are not well understood. Ketone bodies are alternative fuels produced when glucose is limited and improve indicators of healthspan in aging mouse models. Moreover, the most abundant ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate, inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome in myeloid cells, a key potentiator of age-related inflammation. Given that myeloid cells express ketogenic machinery, we hypothesized this pathway may serve as a metabolic checkpoint of inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we conditionally ablated ketogenesis by disrupting expression of the terminal enzyme required for ketogenesis, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Lyase (HMGCL). By deleting HMGCL in the liver, we validated the functional targeting and establish that the liver is the only organ that can produce the life-sustaining quantities of ketone bodies required for survival during fasting or ketogenic diet feeding. Conditional ablation of HMGCL in neutrophils and macrophages had modest effects on body weight and glucose tolerance in aging but worsened glucose homeostasis in myeloid cell-specific Hmgcl-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet. Our results suggest that during aging, liver-derived circulating ketone bodies might be more important for deactivating the NLRP3 inflammasome and controlling organismal metabolism.",PRKAA1; SIRT1; PPARGC1A; PRDM16; UCP1; 0,Male Sprague-Dawley rats; Adult men (n=13),animal; human,Animal – Rat; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"AMPK-SirT1-PGC1alpha pathway, up",Multiple mechanisms,white adipose tissue,Adipose tissue,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"fat browning, up","Fat browning, up",single bout of aerobic exercise in the fasted state,Fasting / Caloric restriction (endogenous),NS
36799478,Contribution of High-Intensity Interval Exercise in the Fasted State to Fat Browning: Potential Roles of Lactate and beta-Hydroxybutyrate.,"PURPOSE: Fat browning contributes to energy consumption and may have metabolic benefits against obesity; however, the potential roles of lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) in fat browning remain unclear. We investigated the roles of a single bout of aerobic exercise that increases lactate and beta-HB levels in the fasted state on the regulation of fat browning in rats and humans. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 24-h fasting and/or a single bout moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (40 min): sedentary (CON), exercise (ND-EX), fasting (FAST), and exercise + fasting (F-EX). Adult men ( n = 13) were randomly assigned into control with food intake (CON), exercise with intensity at onset of blood lactate accumulation in the fasted state (F-OBLA), and high-intensity interval exercise in the fasted state (F-HIIE) until each participant expended 350 kcal of energy. For evaluating the effects of exercise intensity in rats, we conducted another set of animal experiment, including groups of sedentary fed control, fasting control, and exercise with moderate-intensity or HIIE for 40 min after a 24-h fasting. RESULTS: Regardless of fasting, single bout of exercise increases the concentration of lactate and beta-HB in rats, but the exercise in the fasted state increases the beta-HB level more significantly in rats and humans. F-EX-activated fat browning (AMPK-SirT1-PGC1alpha pathway and PRDM16) and thermogenic factor (UCP1) in white fat of rats. In rats and humans, exercise in the fasted state increased the blood levels of fat browning-related adipomyokines. In particular, compared with F-OBLA, F-HIIE more efficiently increases free fatty acid as well as blood levels of fat browning adipomyokines in humans, which was correlated with blood levels of lactate and beta-HB. In rats that performed exercise with different intensity, the higher plasma lactate and beta-HB levels, and higher expression of p-AMPK, UCP1, and PRDM16 in white adipose tissue of HIIE group than those of moderate-intensity group, were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A single bout of aerobic exercise in the fasted state significantly induced fat browning-related pathways, free fatty acid, and adipomyokines, particularly F-HIIE in human. Although further evidence for supporting our results is required in humans, aerobic exercise in the fasted state with high intensity that increase lactate and beta-HB may be a modality of fat browning.",0,isolated perfused rat heart,animal,Animal – Rat,"glycolysis, down",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",4 mM [(14) C]betaHB,In vitro media supplementation,D-BHB

As a glucose store, glycogen may also furnish anaplerosis. We determined the effects of glycogen content on betaHB oxidation and glycolytic rates, and their downstream effects on energetics, in the isolated rat heart. High glycogen (HG) and low glycogen (LG) containing hearts were perfused with 11 mM [5-(3) H]glucose and/or 4 mM [(14) C]betaHB to measure glycolytic rates or betaHB oxidation, respectively, then freeze-clamped for glycogen and metabolomic analyses. Free cytosolic [NAD(+) ]/[NADH] and mitochondrial [Q(+) ]/[QH(2) ] ratios were estimated using the lactate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase reaction, respectively. Phosphocreatine (PCr) and inorganic phosphate (P(i) ) concentrations were measured using (31) P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Rates of betaHB oxidation in LG hearts were half that in HG hearts, with betaHB oxidation directly proportional to glycogen content. betaHB oxidation decreased glycolysis in all hearts. Glycogenolysis in glycogen-replete hearts perfused with betaHB alone was twice that of hearts perfused with betaHB and glucose, which had significantly higher levels of the glycolytic intermediates fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate, and higher free cytosolic [NAD(+) ]/[NADH]. betaHB oxidation increased the Krebs cycle intermediates citrate, 2-oxoglutarate and succinate, the total NADP/H pool, reduced mitochondrial [Q(+) ]/[QH(2) ], and increased the calculated free energy of ATP hydrolysis (∆G(ATP) ). Although betaHB oxidation inhibited glycolysis, glycolytic intermediates were not depleted, and cytosolic free NAD remained oxidised. betaHB oxidation alone increased Krebs cycle intermediates, reduced mitochondrial Q and increased ∆G(ATP) . We conclude that glycogen facilitates cardiac betaHB oxidation by anaplerosis. KEY POINTS: Ketone bodies (d-beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate) are increasingly recognised as important cardiac energetic substrates, in both healthy and diseased hearts. As 2-carbon equivalents they are cataplerotic, causing depletion of Krebs cycle intermediates; therefore their utilisation requires anaplerotic supplementation, and intra-myocardial glycogen has been suggested as a potential anaplerotic source during ketone oxidation. It is demonstrated here that cardiac glycogen does indeed provide anaplerotic substrate to facilitate beta-hydroxybutyrate oxidation in isolated perfused rat heart, and this contribution was quantified using a novel pulse-chase metabolic approach. Further, using metabolomics and (31) P-MR, it was shown that glycolytic flux from myocardial glycogen increased the heart's ability to oxidise betaHB, and betaHB oxidation increased the mitochondrial redox potential, ultimately increasing the free energy of ATP hydrolysis.",GCG; AKT1; STAT3; IRS2; DGKE; FFAR3,murine GLUTag cells; differentiated human jejunal enteroid monolayers,in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Organoids/3D cultures,"PI3K signalling, NS","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",epithelial layer of the gut,Gastrointestinal (unspecified segment),enteroendocrine cells (EECs),Epithelial – Gastrointestinal,Enteroendocrine cells,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"GLP-1 secretion, down","Insulin secretion, down",NS,NS,NS
36834515,betaHB inhibits glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion in GLUTag and human jejunal enteroids.,"Ingestion of nutrients stimulates incretin secretion from enteroendocrine cells (EECs) of the epithelial layer of the gut. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is one of these incretins that stimulate postprandial insulin release and signal satiety to the brain. Understanding the regulation of incretin secretion might open up new therapeutic options for obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus. To investigate the inhibitory effect of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) on glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion from EECs, in vitro cultures of murine GLUTag cells and differentiated human jejunal enteroid monolayers were stimulated with glucose to induce GLP-1 secretion. The effect of betaHB on GLP-1 secretion was studied using ELISA and ECLIA methods. GLUTag cells stimulated with glucose and betaHB were analysed using global proteomics focusing on cellular signalling pathways and the results were verified by Western blot. Results demonstrated betaHB had a significant inhibitory effect on glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion at a dose of 100 mM in GLUTag cells. In differentiated human jejunal enteroid monolayers, glucose-induced secretion of GLP-1 was inhibited at a much lower dose of 10 mM betaHB. The addition of betaHB to GLUTag cells resulted in decreased phosphorylation of kinase AKT and transcription factor STAT3 and also influenced the expressions of signalling molecule IRS-2, kinase DGKepsilon and receptor FFAR3. In conclusion, betaHB displays an inhibitory effect on glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion in vitro in GLUTag cells and in differentiated human jejunal enteroid monolayers.

36849121,The Ketogenic Diet and Neuroinflammation: The Action of Beta-Hydroxybutyrate in a Microglial Cell Line.,"The ketogenic diet (KD), a diet high in fat and protein but low in carbohydrates, is gaining much interest due to its positive effects, especially in neurodegenerative diseases. Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the major ketone body produced during the carbohydrate deprivation that occurs in KD, is assumed to have neuroprotective effects, although the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects are still unclear. Microglial cell activation plays a key role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, resulting in the production of several proinflammatory secondary metabolites. The following study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which BHB determines the activation processes of BV2 microglial cells, such as polarization, cell migration and expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, in the absence or in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a proinflammatory stimulus. The results showed that BHB has a neuroprotective effect in BV2 cells, inducing both microglial polarization towards an M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype and reducing migratory capacity following LPS stimulation. Furthermore, BHB significantly reduced expression levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 and increased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. From this study, it can be concluded that BHB, and consequently the KD, has a fundamental role in neuroprotection and prevention in neurodegenerative diseases, presenting new therapeutic targets.",0; HR,endurance-trained adults (n=15),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"blood pH, down",Ion & Nutrient Transport,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",KE,Ketone ester (KE),NS

We hypothesized that KE versus placebo ingestion would increase Q , and coingestion of the pH buffer bicarbonate would mitigate this effect. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, crossover manner, 15 endurance-trained adults (peak oxygen uptake (V̇O 2peak ), 60 +/- 9 mL.kg -1 .min -1 ) ingested either 0.2 g.kg -1 sodium bicarbonate or a salt placebo 60 min before exercise, and 0.6 g.kg -1 KE or a ketone-free placebo 30 min before exercise. Supplementation yielded three experimental conditions: basal ketone bodies and neutral pH (CON), hyperketonemia and blood acidosis (KE), and hyperketonemia and neutral pH (KE + BIC). Exercise involved 30 min of cycling at ventilatory threshold intensity, followed by determinations of V̇O 2peak and peak Q . RESULTS: Blood [beta-hydroxybutyrate], a ketone body, was higher in KE (3.5 +/- 0.1 mM) and KE + BIC (4.4 +/- 0.2) versus CON (0.1 +/- 0.0, P < 0.0001). Blood pH was lower in KE versus CON (7.30 +/- 0.01 vs 7.34 +/- 0.01, P < 0.001) and KE + BIC (7.35 +/- 0.01, P < 0.001). Q during submaximal exercise was not different between conditions (CON: 18.2 +/- 3.6, KE: 17.7 +/- 3.7, KE + BIC: 18.1 +/- 3.5 L.min -1 ; P = 0.4). HR was higher in KE (153 +/- 9 bpm) and KE + BIC (154 +/- 9) versus CON (150 +/- 9, P < 0.02). V̇O 2peak ( P = 0.2) and peak Q ( P = 0.3) were not different between conditions, but peak workload was lower in KE (359 +/- 61 W) and KE + BIC (363 +/- 63) versus CON (375 +/- 64, P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: KE ingestion did not increase Q during submaximal exercise despite a modest elevation of HR. This response occurred independent of blood acidosis and was associated with a lower workload at V̇O 2peak .",0,41 patients with episodic migraine,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"circumvent metabolic abnormalities, down",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Migraine without aura,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"migraine days, down","Migraine frequency, down",Exogenous BHB,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
36893302,Defining metabolic migraine with a distinct subgroup of patients with suboptimal inflammatory and metabolic markers.,"Emerging evidence suggest migraine is a response to cerebral energy deficiency or oxidative stress in the brain. Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is likely able to circumvent some of the meta-bolic abnormalities reported in migraine. Exogenous BHB was given to test this assumption and, in this post-hoc analysis, multiple metabolic biomarkers were identified to predict clinical improvements. A randomized clinical trial, involving 41 patients with episodic migraine. Each treatment period was 12 weeks long, followed by eight weeks of washout phase / second run-in phase before entering the corresponding second treatment period. The primary endpoint was the number of migraine days in the last 4 weeks of treatment adjusted for baseline. BHB re-sponders were identified (those with at least a 3-day reduction in migraine days over placebo) and its predictors were evaluated using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) stepwise boot-strapped analysis and logistic regression. Responder analysis showed that metabolic markers could identify a ""metabolic migraine"" subgroup, which responded to BHB with a 5.7 migraine days reduction compared to the placebo. This analysis provides further support for a ""metabolic migraine"" subtype. Additionally, these analyses identified low-cost and easily accessible biomarkers that could guide recruitment in future research on this subgroup of patients.This study is part of the trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03132233, registered on 27.04.2017, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03132233.",0,Sprague-Dawley rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"metabolic responses, up",Metabolic Regulation,skeletal muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"maximal carrying capacity, up; maximum number of HIIE sessions, up; time to exhaustion, no-change","Carrying capacity, up; Exercise capacity, up; Endurance capacity, no-change",beta-HB salt (KE),Multi-source,NS

However, the effects of acute beta-HB supplementation on different modalities of exercise performance remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the effects of acute beta-HB administration on the exercise performance of rats. METHODS: In study 1, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups: endurance exercise (EE + PL and EE + KE), resistance exercise (RE + PL and RE + KE), and high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE + PL and HIIE + KE) with placebo (PL) or beta-HB salt (KE) administration. In study 2, metabolome analysis using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry was performed to profile the effects of beta-HB salt administration on HIIE-induced metabolic responses in the skeletal and heart muscles. RESULTS: The maximal carrying capacity (rest for 3 min after each ladder climb, while carrying heavy weights until the rats could not climb) in the RE + KE group was higher than that in the RE + PL group. The maximum number of HIIE sessions (a 20-s swimming session with a 10-s rest between sessions, while bearing a weight equivalent to 16% of body weight) in the HIIE + KE group was higher than that in the HIIE + PL group. However, there was no significant difference in the time to exhaustion at 30 m.min -1 between the EE + PL and the EE + KE groups. Metabolome analysis showed that the overall tricarboxylic acid cycle and creatine phosphate levels in the skeletal muscle were higher in the HIIE + KE group than those in the HIIE + PL group. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that acute beta-HB salt administration may accelerate HIIE and RE performance, and the changes in metabolic responses in the skeletal muscle after beta-HB salt administration may be involved in the enhancement of HIIE performance.",0,12 men,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"glucose rate of appearance, down; glucose rate of disappearance, down; exogenous glucose oxidation, no-change; plasma glucose oxidation, no-change; metabolic clearance rate (MCR), no-change",Metabolic Regulation; Metabolic Regulation,plasma,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"time to exhaustion, down; time trial performance, down","Endurance capacity, down",573 mg KE/kg body mass plus 110 g glucose (KE+CHO),Ketone ester (KE),NS

However, no studies have examined the effect of ketone supplementation on glucose kinetics during exercise. OBJECTIVES: This exploratory study primarily aimed to determine the effect of KE plus carbohydrate supplementation on glucose oxidation during steady-state exercise and physical performance compared with carbohydrate alone. METHODS: Using a randomly assigned, crossover design, 12 men consumed 573 mg KE/kg body mass plus 110 g glucose (KE+CHO) or 110 g glucose (CHO) before and during 90 min of steady-state treadmill exercise [54 +/- 3% peak oxygen uptake (V O(2peak))] wearing a weighted vest (30% body mass; 25 +/- 3 kg). Glucose oxidation and turnover were determined using indirect calorimetry and stable isotopes. Participants performed an unweighted time to exhaustion (TTE; 85% V O(2peak)) after steady-state exercise and a weighted (25 +/- 3 kg) 6.4 km time trial (TT) the next day after consuming a bolus of KE+CHO or CHO. Data were analyzed by paired t-tests and mixed model ANOVA. RESULTS: betaHB concentrations were higher (P < 0.05) after exercise [2.1 mM (95% CI: 1.6, .6)] and the TT [2.6 mM (2.1, 3.1)] in KE+CHO compared with CHO. TTE was lower [-104 s (-201, -8)], and TT performance was slower [141 s (19,262)] in KE+CHO than in CHO (P < 0.05). Exogenous [-0.01 g/min (-0.07, 0.04)] and plasma [-0.02 g/min (-0.08, 0.04)] glucose oxidation and metabolic clearance rate MCR [0.38 mg.kg(-1).min(-1) (-0.79, 1.54)] were not different, and glucose rate of appearance [-0.51 mg.kg(-1).min(-1) (-0.97, -0.04)], and disappearance [-0.50 mg.kg(-1).min(-1) (-0.96, -0.04)] were lower (P < 0.05) in KE+CHO compared with CHO during steady-state exercise. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, rates of exogenous and plasma glucose oxidation and MCR were not different between treatments during steady-state exercise, suggesting blood glucose utilization is similar between KE+CHO and CHO.

However, alleviating OA progression through senescent chondrocyte intervention still faces great challenges. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) exhibits anti-senescence effects in a variety of age-related dis-eases, but its role in osteoarthritis remains poorly understood. To explore the molecular mechanisms, gene sequencing was used to identify critical genes and potential cellular signaling pathways and male SD rats were used to generate an osteoarthritis model. Results showed that BHB attenuated the senescence of Osteoarthritis chondrocytes (OA-Chos) and alleviated OA progression. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed significant changes in cell cycle genes, with PTEN being the most significant differentially expressed gene. BHB up-regulated the expression of PTEN in OA-Chos, thereby alleviating chondrocyte senescence. Furthermore, BHB facilitated the expression of PTEN by binding to hnRNP A1 and inhibiting the phosphorylation of Akt. This study provided evidence that BHB mitigated chondrocyte senescence and delayed OA, and could thus be used as a novel therapeutic approach for osteoarthritis treatment.",HDAC2; HDAC3; SLC6A1,patients with stroke; rodents with stroke,human; animal,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Animal – Other Mammal,"HDAC2/HDAC3-GAT-1 signaling-mediated enhancement of excitability and phasic GABA inhibition, up",Epigenetic Regulation,peri-infarct cortex,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Stroke,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"functional recovery, up","Neurological deficit score, up",NS,NS,NS

Here, we show that beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), an essential ketone body (KB) component, is positively correlated with improved outcomes in patients with stroke and promotes functional recovery in rodents with stroke during the repair phase. These beneficial effects of beta-HB depend on HDAC2/HDAC3-GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1) signaling-mediated enhancement of excitability and phasic GABA inhibition in the peri-infarct cortex and structural and functional plasticity in the ipsilateral cortex, the contralateral cortex, and the corticospinal tract.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the response to a hypocaloric, well-formulated ketogenic diet (KD), with and without the inclusion of two daily racemic KS doses (6 g R-BHB + 6 g S-BHB per serving) on 1) daily fasting capillary R-BHB and glucose (R-BHB/GLU(fast)), 2) bi-weekly 13 h diurnal BHB and glucose (R-BHB/GLU(diur)), 3) three-hours post-KS ingestion kinetics (R-BHB(KS)), and 4) bi-weekly fasting plasma enantiomer-specific BHB (R/S-BHB(plasma)). METHODS: Non-diabetic adults with overweight and obesity were randomized to receive a precisely measured hypocaloric KD ( approximately 75 %en of maintenance) for six weeks, supplemented twice-daily with KS or placebo (PL). A non-randomized comparison group was provided an isonitrogenous/isoenergetic low-fat diet (LFD). All meals were provided to subjects. Capillary blood was collected daily to measure R-BHB/GLU(fast) and hourly for R-BHB/GLU(diur). Plasma was collected to measure R/S-BHB(plasma), insulin, fasting glucose, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Total AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal method. RESULTS: Mean R-BHB(fast) increased significantly during KD + PL (1.0 mM BHB), an effect enhanced 26% during KD + KS. GLU(fast) AUC was -6% lower during KD + KS versus LFD. Mean R-BHB(diur) increased 40% in KD + KS versus KD + PL, whereas GLU(diur) decreased 13% during both KDs versus LFD. R-BHB(KS) peaked (Delta: approximately 1 mM) 1 h after the morning KS dose, but not following the afternoon dose. Both R/S-BHB(plasma) increased during KD independent of KS inclusion. R-BHB(plasma) was 50-times greater compared to S-BHB(plasma), and the KS augmented S-BHB(plasma) 50% more than PL. Fasting insulin and HOMA-IR decreased after 14 days independent of diet. CONCLUSIONS: A hypocaloric KD was effective at reducing diurnal glucose compared to a LFD independent of weight loss, but twice-daily racemic KS ingestion during KD augmented ketonemia, both as R- and S-BHB, and decreased mean fasting glucose beyond a KD alone.

36996634,Protective Potential of beta-Hydroxybutyrate against Glucose-Deprivation-Induced Neurotoxicity Involving the Modulation of Autophagic Flux and the Monomeric Abeta Level in Neuro-2a Cells.,"Hypoglycemia has been known as a potential contributory factor to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. There may be shared pathogenic mechanisms underlying both conditions, and the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), as an alternative substrate for glucose may exert neuroprotection against hypoglycemia-induced injury. To investigate this, Neuro-2a cells were subjected to a 24 h period of glucose deprivation with or without the presence of BHB. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, apoptosis, autophagy, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) levels were evaluated. The results show that Neuro-2a cells deprived of glucose displayed a significant loss of cell survival with a corresponding decrease in ATP levels, suggesting that glucose deprivation was neurotoxic. This effect was likely attributed to the diverse mechanisms including raised ROS, defective autophagic flux and reduced basal Abeta levels (particularly monomeric Abeta). The presence of BHB could partially protect against the loss of cell survival induced by glucose deprivation. The mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective actions of BHB might be mediated, at least in part, through restoring ATP, and modulating ROS production, autophagy flux efficacy and the monomeric Abeta level. Results imply that a possible link between the basal monomeric Abeta and glucose deprivation neurotoxicity, and treatments designed for the prevention of energy impairment, such as BHB, may be beneficial for rescuing surviving cells in relation to neurodegeneration.",NEFL,relapsing MS patients; historical untreated MS controls,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,serum,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Multiple sclerosis,Autoimmune & Inflammatory,"neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, down","Biomarker level, down",serum beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

METHODS: Thirty-nine subjects with relapsing MS completed a 6-month ketogenic diet intervention. NfL levels were assayed at both baseline (pre-diet) and 6-months on-diet. In addition, ketogenic diet study participants were compared to a cohort (n = 31) of historical, untreated MS controls. RESULTS: Baseline (pre-diet) mean NfL was 5.45 pg/ml (95% CI 4.59 - 6.31). After 6 months on ketogenic diet, mean NfL was not significantly changed (5.49 pg/ml; 95% CI 4.82 - 6.19). Compared to untreated MS controls (mean 15.17 pg/ml), NfL levels for the ketogenic diet cohort were relatively low. MS subjects with higher levels of ketosis (as measured by serum beta-hydroxybutyrate) exhibited greater reductions in NfL between baseline and 6-months on ketogenic diet. CONCLUSIONS: Ketogenic diets do not worsen biomarkers of neurodegeneration in relapsing MS patients, with stable, low levels of NfL observed throughout the diet intervention. Subjects with greater biomarkers of ketosis experienced a higher degree of improvement in serum NfL.

37032786,Autophagy regulates the release of exercise factors and their beneficial effects on spatial memory recall.,"Exercise promotes learning and memory recall as well as rescues cognitive decline associated with aging. The positive effects of exercise are mediated by circulatory factors that predominantly increase Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) signaling in the hippocampus. Identifying the pathways that regulate the release of the circulatory factors by various tissues during exercise and that mediate hippocampal Mus musculus Bdnf expression will allow us to harness the therapeutic potential of exercise. Here, we report that two weeks of voluntary exercise in male mice activates autophagy in the hippocampus by increasing LC3B protein levels (p = 0.0425) and that autophagy is necessary for exercise-induced spatial learning and memory retention (p < 0.001; exercise + autophagy inhibitor chloroquine CQ versus exercise). We place autophagy downstream of hippocampal BDNF signaling and identify a positive feedback activation between the pathways. We also assess whether the modulation of autophagy outside the nervous system is involved in mediating exercise's effect on learning and memory recall. Indeed, plasma collected from young exercise mice promote spatial learning (p = 0.0446; exercise versus sedentary plasma) and memory retention in aged inactive mice (p = 0.0303; exercise versus sedentary plasma), whereas plasma collected from young exercise mice that received the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine diphosphate failed to do so. We show that the release of exercise factors that reverse the symptoms of aging into the circulation is dependent on the activation of autophagy in young animals. Indeed, we show that the release of the exercise factor, beta-hydroxybutyrate (DBHB), into the circulation, is autophagy-dependent and that DBHB promotes spatial learning and memory formation (p = 0.0005) by inducing hippocampal autophagy (p = 0.0479). These results implicate autophagy in peripheral tissues and in the hippocampus in mediating the effects of exercise on learning and memory recall and identify DBHB as a candidate endogenous exercise factor whose release and positive effects are autophagy-dependent.",CPT1A,C57BL/6 mice; unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO); NRK52E cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"FAO via FFAR3-dependent pathway, up",Metabolic Regulation,kidney,Kidney,NRK52E cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Renal fibrosis,Renal & Urological,"renal fibrosis, down","Fibrosis, down",KD; beta-OHB,Ketogenic diet (endogenous); NS,NS

METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet or a KD for 6 weeks prior to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), a well-established in vivo model of renal fibrosis in rodents. Seven days after UUO, serum and kidney samples were collected. Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) concentrations and renal fibrosis were assessed. NRK52E cells were treated with TGFbeta1, a fibrosis-inducing cytokine, and with or without beta-OHB, a ketone body metabolized by KD, to investigate the mechanism underlying renal fibrosis. RESULTS: KD significantly enhanced serum beta-OHB levels in mice. Histological analysis revealed that KD alleviated structural destruction and fibrosis in obstructed kidneys and reduced the expression of the fibrosis protein markers alpha-SMA, Col1a1, and Col3a1. Expression of the rate-limiting enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), Cpt1a and Acox1, significantly decreased after UUO and were upregulated by KD. However, the protective effect of KD was abolished by etomoxir (a Cpt1a inhibitor). Besides, our study observed that KD significantly suppressed UUO-induced macrophage infiltration and the expression of IL-6 in the obstructive kidneys. In NRK52E cells, fibrosis-related signaling was increased by TGFbeta1 and reduced by beta-OHB. beta-OHB treatment restored the impaired expression of Cpt1a. The effect of beta-OHB was blocked by siRNA targeting free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3), suggesting that beta-OHB might function through the FFAR3-dependent pathway. DISCUSSION: Our results highlight that KD attenuates UUO-induced renal fibrosis by enhancing FAO via the FFAR3-dependent pathway, which provides a promising dietary therapy for renal fibrosis.",0,nondiabetic porcine model of ischemia-reperfusion; percutaneous proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion 45 min,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"BOHB availability, increased",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,cardiomyocyte,Muscle – Cardiac,Cardiomyocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Ischemia-reperfusion injury,Injury & Trauma,"myocardial salvage, up; MI size, down; microvascular obstruction, down; left ventricle ejection fraction, up; cardiomyocyte apoptosis, down; oxidative stress, down","Neuroprotection, up; Infarct size, down; Vascular reactivity, down; Ejection fraction, up; Apoptosis, down; Oxidative stress, down",intravenous infusion of BOHB,Intravenous BHB,NS
37060184,Cardioprotective Effect of Empagliflozin and Circulating Ketone Bodies During Acute Myocardial Infarction.,"BACKGROUND: SGLT2i (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) improve clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure, but the mechanisms of action are not completely understood. SGLT2i increases circulating levels of ketone bodies, which has been demonstrated to enhance myocardial energetics and induce reverse ventricular remodeling. However, the role of SGLT2i or ketone bodies on myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury remains in the dark. The objective of this study is to investigate the cardioprotective potential of empagliflozin and ketone bodies during acute myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: We used a nondiabetic porcine model of ischemia reperfusion using a percutaneous occlusion of proximal left anterior descending artery for 45 minutes. Animals received 1-week pretreatment with either empagliflozin or placebo prior to MI induction. Additionally, a third group received intravenous infusion of the ketone body BOHB (beta-hydroxybutyrate) during the MI induction. Acute effects of the treatments were assessed 4-hour post-MI by cardiac magnetic resonance and histology (thioflavin for area at risk, triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining for MI size). All animals were euthanized immediately postcardiac magnetic resonance, and heart samples were collected. RESULTS: The area at risk was similar in all groups. Empagliflozin treatment increased BOHB levels. Empagliflozin-treated animals showed significantly higher myocardial salvage, smaller MI size (both by cardiac magnetic resonance and histology), less microvascular obstruction, and improved cardiac function (left ventricle ejection fraction and strain). Furthermore, empagliflozin-treated animals demonstrated reduced biomarkers of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress compared with placebo. The BOHB group showed similar results to the empagliflozin group. CONCLUSIONS: One-week pretreatment with empagliflozin ameliorates ischemia reperfusion injury, reduces MI size and microvascular obstruction, increases myocardial salvage, preserves left ventricle systolic function, and lowers apoptosis and oxidative stress. Periprocedural intravenous infusion of BOHB during myocardial ischemia also induces cardioprotection, suggesting a role for BOHB availability as an additional mechanism within the wide spectrum of actions of SGLT2i.",HMGCS2; APOE,whole-body Hmgcs2 deletion mice; mice; normal mice; aged mice; ApoE-deficient mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Atherosclerosis,Cardiovascular,"life span increased, nan; midlife mortality increased, nan; mortality associated with atherosclerosis decreased, nan","Lifespan, nan; Mortality, nan","diet containing 1,3-butanediol; ad libitum low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet","1,3-Butanediol (BD); Ketogenic diet (endogenous)",NS

However, the precise role of endogenous ketogenesis in mammalian life span, and the safety and efficacy of the long-term exogenous supplementation of ketone bodies remain unclear. In the present study, we show that a deficiency in endogenous ketogenesis, induced by whole-body Hmgcs2 deletion, shortens life span in mice, and that this is prevented by daily ketone body supplementation using a diet containing 1,3-butanediol, a precursor of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Furthermore, feeding the 1,3-butanediol-containing diet from early in life increases midlife mortality in normal mice, but in aged mice it extends life span and prevents the high mortality associated with atherosclerosis in ApoE-deficient mice. By contrast, an ad libitum low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet markedly increases mortality. In conclusion, endogenous ketogenesis affects mammalian survival, and ketone body supplementation may represent a double-edged sword with respect to survival, depending on the method of administration and health status.",0,recreational runners,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"AMPK phosphorylation, down",Metabolic Regulation,skeletal muscle,Skeletal muscle,macrophages,Hematopoietic / Immune,Macrophages,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"mental alertness, up; muscular inflammation, down","Cognition, up; Inflammation, down",ketone ester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (KE),Ketone ester (KE),D-BHB

Therefore, we hypothesized that ketone ester (KE) supplementation can counteract the decline in psychocognitive functioning during ultra-endurance exercise and stimulate muscular recovery. Eighteen recreational runners participated in a full 100 km trail run (RUN, n = 8), or ran to premature exhaustion (80 km: n = 6; 60 km: n = 4). Before (25 g), during (25 g.h(-1)), and after (5 x 25 g in 24 h) RUN they received ketone ester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (KE, n = 9) supplements or a noncaloric placebo (CON, n = 9). Blood samples and muscle biopsies were taken, and mental alertness was assessed by a psychocognitive test battery at different times before, during, and up to 36 h after RUN. Compared with CON (<0.3 mM), in KE blood d-beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration was consistently elevated to approximately 2-3 mM during RUN. In CON, RUN increased visual reaction times from 353 +/- 53 to 419 +/- 54 ms, and movement execution times from 174 +/- 47 to 245 +/- 64 ms. But this effect was fully negated by KE (P < 0.05). Plasma dopamine concentrations doubled in KE during RUN but remained stable in CON, resulting in higher concentrations after RUN in KE (4.1 +/- 1.7 nM) than in CON (2.4 +/- 0.8 nM, P = 0.048). KE also inhibited muscular infiltration of macrophages and suppressed AMPK phosphorylation status until 36-h postexercise (P < 0.05 KE vs. CON). In conclusion, KE increases circulating dopamine concentration and improves mental alertness, as well as improves postexercise muscular inflammation in ultra-endurance exercise.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Oral ketone ester ingestion elevates circulating dopamine concentration during ultra-endurance exercise. This is associated with improved mental alertness. Furthermore, ketone ester intake inhibits postexercise skeletal muscle macrophage infiltration, and counteracts the increase in AMPK phosphorylation after exercise, which indicates improved muscular energy status.",NFE2L2; APP,APP/PS1 mice; C57BL/6 mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"regulation of ferroptosis-related pathways, down",Cell Death & Survival,brain,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"learning and memory, up","Memory (general), up",ketogenic diet-induced elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
37185454,Ketogenic diet alleviates brain iron deposition and cognitive dysfunction via Nrf2-mediated ferroptosis pathway in APP/PS1 mouse.,"Progressive cognitive decline and increased brain iron deposition with age are important features of Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have found that the short-term ketogenic diet has neuroprotective effects in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, but the effects of an early and long-term ketogenic diet on brain iron content and cognition of Alzheimer's disease have not been reported. In our study, 8-week-old APP/PS1 mice were given a 12-month ketogenic or standard diet, while C57BL/6 mice matched with the age and genetic background of APP/PS1 mice were used as normal controls to be given a standard diet for the same length of time. We found that 12 months of an early ketogenic diet improved the impaired learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice. The improvement of cognitive function may be related to the reduction of amyloid-beta deposition and neuronal ferroptosis. The mechanism was achieved by the regulation of ferroptosis-related pathways after activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 by ketogenic diet-induced elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate. In addition, blood biochemical results showed that compared with the standard diet group of the disease, although the early and long-term ketogenic diet increased blood lipids to some extent, it seemed to reduce liver, renal, and myocardial damage caused by genetic differences. This will provide a piece of positive evidence for the early and long-term use of ketogenic diets in people at risk of Alzheimer's disease.",0,trained cyclists (N = 23),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"preexercise venous beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration, up",Metabolic Regulation,venous blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"mean TT power output, down","Exercise capacity, down",(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate KE,Ketone ester (KE),NS

The limited and equivocal data to date are likely related to factors including the KE dose, test conditions, and caliber of athletes studied. We tested the hypothesis that mean power output during a 20-min cycling time trial (TT) would be different after KE ingestion compared to a placebo (PL). A sample size of 22 was estimated to provide 80% power to detect an effect size dz of 0.63 at an alpha level of .05 with a two-tailed paired t test. This determination considered 2.0% as the minimal important difference in performance. Twenty-three trained cyclists (N = 23; peak oxygen uptake: 65 +/- 12 ml.kg-1 min-1; M +/- SD), who were regularly cycling >5 hr/week, completed a familiarization trial followed by two experimental trials. Participants self-selected and replicated their diet and exercise for approximately 24 hr before each trial. Participants ingested either 0.35 g/kg body mass of (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate KE or a flavor-matched PL 30 min before exercise in a randomized, triple-blind, crossover manner. Exercise involved a 15-min warm-up followed by the 20-min TT on a cycle ergometer. The only feedback provided was time elapsed.

Therefore, our objective was to compare the effects of a one-day isocaloric ketogenic diet, fasting and supplementation with ketone salts on energy expenditure and appetite perception. METHODS: Eight healthy young adults (4 women, 4 men, age 24 +/- 3 years, BMI 24.3 +/- 3.1 kg/m(2)) participated in a randomized cross-over trial with four 24 h-interventions in a whole room indirect calorimeter at a physical activity level of 1.65: (i) total fasting (FAST), (ii) isocaloric ketogenic diet (3.1% energy from carbohydrates (CHO), KETO), (iii) isocaloric control diet (47.4% energy from CHO, ISO), and (iv) ISO supplemented with 38.7 g/d ketone salts (exogenous ketones, EXO). Effects on serum ketone levels (15 h-iAUC), energy metabolism (total energy expenditure, TEE; sleeping energy expenditure, SEE; macronutrient oxidation) and subjective appetite were measured. RESULTS: Compared to ISO, ketone levels were considerably higher with FAST and KETO and little higher with EXO (all p > 0.05). Total and sleeping energy expenditure did not differ between ISO, FAST and EXO whereas KETO increased TEE (+110 +/- 54 kcal/d vs. ISO, p < 0.05) and SEE (+201 +/- 90 kcal/d vs. ISO, p < 0.05). CHO oxidation was slightly decreased with EXO compared to ISO (-48 +/- 27 g/d, p < 0.05) resulting in a positive CHO balance (p < 0.05). No differences between the interventions were found for subjective appetite ratings (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: A 24 h-ketogenic diet may contribute to maintain a neutral energy balance by increasing energy expenditure. Exogenous ketones in addition to an isocaloric diet did not improve regulation of energy balance.

Recent findings suggest that migraine attacks are a response to the cerebral energy deficit, and ingestion of ketone bodies stabilizes the generation of a migraine attack. Based on these findings, ketone body supplementation is postulated as a prophylactic treatment approach to restore cerebral metabolism deficiency. Metabolic markers are unexplored after exogenous ketone body supplementation in episodic migraineurs. Therefore, the present single-arm uncontrolled explorative analysis evaluated blood ketone body and glucose concentration after short and long-term 6 g exogenous DL-Mg-Ca-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DL-betaHB) supplementation. Methods: The presented data are part of the MigraKet randomized-control cross-over clinical trial of 41 episodic migraineurs (Number NCT03132233). Patients were given a single dose of 6 g DL-betaHB. Ketone body and glucose blood concentration were assessed before intake, 20, and 40 min after DL-betaHB intake. Ketone body, glucose concentration and glycated hemoglobin values were evaluated after 12 weeks of 18 g DL-betaHB ingestion (total dose), taken three times daily (6g/dose; 3x/day). Linear models explored the association between the ketone body and glucose levels. Results: Ketone body concentration increased within-group to a mean of 0.46 (0.30) mmol/L after 40 min post- DL-betaHB supplementation [estimate = 0.24 mmol/L, CI = (0.20.0.27), p < 0.01]. This within-group increase of ketone body concentration did not change after repeated daily intake of DL-betaHB supplementation over 12 weeks [estimate = 0.00 mmol/L, CI = (-0.03.0.04), p = 0.794]. DL-betaHB intake significantly reduced blood glucose concentration within-group from a mean baseline of 4.91 (0.42) mmol/L to 4.75 (0.47) mmol/L 40 min post-DL-betaHB supplementation [estimate = -0.16 mmol/L, CI = (-0.15, 0.03), p < 0.01]. Repeated DL-betaHB supplementation for 12 weeks showed no change within-group in acute ketone bodies concentration [estimate = 0.00 mmol/L, CI = (-0.03.0.04), p = 0.794] and in the HbA1c value [estimate = 0.02, CI = (-0.07.0.11), p = 0.69]. Conclusion: A single dose of 6 g DL-betaHB significantly elevated blood ketone bodies and decreased blood glucose concentration within-group in episodic migraineurs. Long-term DL-betaHB supplementation for 12 weeks showed no effect within-group on acute ketone body concentration and had not impact on HbA1c. The elevation of the ketone body concentration was moderate, indicating that nutritional ketosis was not reached. Therefore, a dose higher than 6 g of DL-betaHB is required to reach the nutritional level of ketosis.

Since the antioxidant response lack could depend on the hypoacetylation of genes coding for detoxifying enzymes, we treated lymphoblasts and fibroblasts mutated for the FANC-A gene with some histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), namely, valproic acid (VPA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHB), and EX527 (a Sirt1 inhibitor), under basal conditions and after hydrogen peroxide addition. The results show that VPA increased catalase and glutathione reductase expression and activity, corrected the metabolic defect, lowered lipid peroxidation, restored the mitochondrial fusion and fission balance, and improved mitomycin survival. In contrast, OHB, despite a slight increase in antioxidant enzyme expressions, exacerbated the metabolic defect, increasing oxidative stress production, probably because it also acts as an oxidative phosphorylation metabolite, while EX527 showed no effect. In conclusion, the data suggest that VPA could be a promising drug to modulate the gene expression in FA cells, confirming that the antioxidant response modulation plays a pivotal in FA pathogenesis as it acts on both oxidative stress levels and the mitochondrial metabolism and dynamics quality.",PER1; PER2; 0; DBP,mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"blood beta-hydroxybutyrate, up",Metabolic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"REM sleep duration, down","Sleep duration, down",MCT-KD,MCT / Medium-chain fats,NS

However, these diets were designed to simulate a fasting state; thus, whether these effects are caused by diet-induced ketogenesis or persistent starvation is difficult to distinguish. The present study aimed to define the effects of a KD containing medium-chain triglycerides (MCT-KD) that increase blood ketone levels without inducing carbohydrate starvation, on circadian rhythms and sleep regulation. Mice were fed with a normal diet (CTRL) or MCT-KD for 2 weeks. Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were significantly increased up to 2 mM by the MCT-KD, whereas body weight gain and blood glucose levels were identical between the groups, suggesting that ketosis accumulated without carbohydrate starvation in the MCT-KD mice. Circadian rhythms of wheel-running activity and core body temperature were almost identical, although wheel-running was slightly reduced in the MCT-KD mice. The circadian expression of the core clock genes, Per1, Per2, Bmal1, and Dbp in the hypothalamus, heart, liver, epididymal adipose tissues, and skeletal muscle were almost identical between the CTRL and MCT-KD mice, whereas the amplitude of hepatic Per2 and adipose Per1 expression was increased in MCT-KD mice. The MCT-KD reduced the duration of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep without affecting the duration of non-REM sleep and the duration of wakefulness.

Therefore, we determined whether ketone ester (KE) intake could counteract sleep disruptions induced by strenuous exercise. METHODS: Ten well-trained cyclists with good sleep quality participated in a randomized crossover design consisting of two experimental sessions each involving a morning endurance training and an evening high-intensity interval training ending 1 h before sleep, after which polysomnography was performed overnight. Postexercise and 30 min before sleeping time, subjects received either 25 g of KE (EX KE ) or a placebo drink (EX CON ). A third session without exercise but with placebo supplements (R CON ) was added to evaluate the effect of exercise per se on sleep. RESULTS: Blood d -beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations transiently increased to ~3 mM postexercise and during the first part of the night in EX KE but not in EX CON or R CON . Exercise significantly reduced rapid eye movement sleep by 26% ( P = 0.001 vs R CON ) and increased wakefulness after sleep onset by 95% ( P = 0.004 vs R CON ). Interestingly, KE improved sleep efficiency by 3% ( P = 0.040 vs EX CON ) and counteracted the exercise-induced decrease in rapid eye movement sleep ( P = 0.011 vs EX CON ) and the increase in wakefulness after sleep onset ( P = 0.009 vs EX CON ). This was accompanied by a KE-induced increase in dopamine excretion ( P = 0.033 vs EX CON ), which plays a pivotal role in sleep regulation. In addition, exercise increased sleep spindle density by 36% ( P = 0.005 vs R CON ), suggesting an effect on neural plasticity processes during sleep. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that KE ingestion improves sleep efficiency and quality after high-intensity exercise.

There is no simple treatment to alleviate ischemic brain injury, as thrombolytic therapy is applicable within a narrow time window. During the last years, the ketogenic diet (KD) and the exogenous administration of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) have been proposed as therapeutic tools for acute neurological disorders and both can reduce ischemic brain injury. However, the mechanisms involved are not completely clear. We have previously shown that the D enantiomer of BHB stimulates the autophagic flux in cultured neurons exposed to glucose deprivation (GD) and in the brain of hypoglycemic rats. Here, we have investigated the effect of the systemic administration of D-BHB, followed by its continuous infusion after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), on the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Results show for the first time that the protective effect of BHB against MCAO injury is enantiomer selective as only D-BHB, the physiologic enantiomer of BHB, significantly reduced brain injury. D-BHB treatment prevented the cleavage of the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2 and stimulated the autophagic flux in the ischemic core and the penumbra. In addition, D-BHB notably reduced the activation of the PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4 pathway of the UPR and inhibited IRE1alpha phosphorylation. L-BHB showed no significant effect relative to ischemic animals. In cortical cultures under GD, D-BHB prevented LAMP2 cleavage and decreased lysosomal number.

Ketogenic diet (KD) exerts beneficial effects in various diseases, but whether it could serve as non-drug therapy for neointimal hyperplasia remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of KD on neointimal hyperplasia and the potential mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Carotid artery balloon-injury model was employed in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce neointimal hyperplasia. Then, animals were subjected to either standard rodent chow or KD. For in-vitro experiment, impacts of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), the main mediator of KD effects, on platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration and proliferation were determined. Balloon injury induced event intimal hyperplasia and upregulation of protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and these changes were significantly ameliorated by KD. In addition, beta-HB could markedly inhibit PDGF-BB induced VMSC migration and proliferation, as well as inhibiting expressions of PCNA and alpha-SMC. Furthermore, KD inhibited balloon-injury induced oxidative stress in carotid artery, indicated by reduced ROS level, malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. We also found balloon-injury induced inflammation in carotid artery was suppressed by KD, indicated by decreased expressions of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, and increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. CONCLUSION: KD attenuates neointimal hyperplasia through suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation to inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration. KD may represent a promising non-drug therapy for neointimal hyperplasia associated diseases.",APP; 0,in vitro; ex vivo; mouse; nematode,animal; in vitro,NS; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice; Animal – Mouse; Animal – Invertebrate,"autophagy, up",Cell Death & Survival,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Aging; Alzheimer's disease,Aging & Frailty; Neurodegenerative,"amyloid-beta aggregation toxicity, down; neurodegeneration-related protein levels, down","Neurotoxicity, down; Neurodegeneration, down",ketone ester; exogenous betaHB,Ketone ester (KE); Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
37478810,beta-hydroxybutyrate is a metabolic regulator of proteostasis in the aged and Alzheimer disease brain.,"Loss of proteostasis is a hallmark of aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we identify beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), a ketone body, as a regulator of protein solubility in the aging brain. betaHB is a small molecule metabolite which primarily provides an oxidative substrate for ATP during hypoglycemic conditions, and also regulates other cellular processes through covalent and noncovalent protein interactions. We demonstrate betaHB-induced protein insolubility across in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo mouse systems. This activity is shared by select structurally similar metabolites, is not dependent on covalent protein modification, pH, or solute load, and is observable in mouse brain in vivo after delivery of a ketone ester. Furthermore, this phenotype is selective for pathological proteins such as amyloid-beta, and exogenous betaHB ameliorates pathology in nematode models of amyloid-beta aggregation toxicity. We have generated a comprehensive atlas of the betaHB-induced protein insolublome ex vivo and in vivo using mass spectrometry proteomics, and have identified common protein domains within betaHB target sequences. Finally, we show enrichment of neurodegeneration-related proteins among betaHB targets and the clearance of these targets from mouse brain, likely via betaHB-induced autophagy. Overall, these data indicate a new metabolically regulated mechanism of proteostasis relevant to aging and AD.",0,critically ill children (term newborn-18 years) in PICU; randomized to intermittent feeding (n=67); continuous feeding (n=73),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Human – Interventional; NS,"ketosis, up",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels, up; hypoglycaemic incidents, no-change; feeding intolerance, no-change","Blood ketones (BHB), up; Blood glucose, no-change; Feeding intolerance, no-change",NS,NS,NS

It was previously shown that a fasting response, reflected by increased ketosis, at least partly explained the beneficial outcome of delayed initiation of supplemental parenteral nutrition. This study aims to investigate whether an overnight fast increases ketosis and is feasible and safe in critically ill children. METHODS: The Continuousversus Intermittent Nutrition in Paediatric Intensive Care (ContInNuPIC) study is a randomised controlled trial in a tertiary referral Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in the Netherlands. Critically ill children (term newborn-18 years) with an expected PICU stay >/=48 h, dependent on artificial nutrition, were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified for age group) to intermittent feeding, with interruption of feedings during an age-dependent overnight period of eight to 12 h, or to continuous feeding, with the administration of feedings day and night. In both groups, similar daily caloric targets were pursued. For children younger than one year, mandatory minor glucose infusions were provided during fasting. The primary outcome was the feasibility, defined as two conditions (1): a significant difference in the patients' highest daily ketone (3-beta-hydroxybutyrate, BHB) levels during each overnight period, and (2): non-inferiority regarding daily caloric intake, examined using a two-part mixed-effects model with a predefined non-inferiority margin of 33%, in an intention-to-treat analysis. The study is registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NL7877). RESULTS: Between May 19, 2020, and July 13, 2022, 140 critically ill children, median (first quartile; third quartile) age 0.3 (0.1; 2.7) years, were randomised to intermittent (n = 67) or continuous feeding (n = 73). In the intermittent feeding group, BHB levels were significantly higher (median 0.4 (0.2; 1.0) vs. 0.3 (0.1; 0.7) mmol/L, p < 0.001). The ratio of total caloric intake in the intermittent feeding group to the intake in the continuous feeding group was not consistently significantly more than 0.67, thus not proving non-inferiority. No severe, resistant hypoglycaemic events, nor severe gastrointestinal complications related to the intervention occurred, and feeding intolerance did not occur more often in the intermittent than in the continuous feeding group. CONCLUSION: Compared with day and night feeding, intermittent feeding with an overnight fast and mandatory glucose infusion for children younger than one year marginally increased ketosis and did not lead to more hypoglycaemic incidents in critically ill children. Because non-inferiority regarding daily caloric intake was not proven, the feasibility of an overnight fast could not be shown in the current study. However, as feeding intolerance did not increase during the condensed feeding periods, the nutritional intake was probably limited by the prescription of nutrition and interruptions.

This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of KD pretreatment and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB, bioactive product of KD) post-treatment in a mouse model of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Neurological function, infarct volume, as well as inflammatory reactions are evaluated 24 h after ischemia. Results showed that both KD pretreatment or BHB post-treatment improved the Bederson score and Grip test score, reduced infarct volume and the extravasation of IgG, suppressed the over-activation of microglia, and modulated the expression of cytokines. Mechanically, we found that both KD pretreatment or BHB post-treatment significantly stimulated the expression of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase M (IRAKM) and then inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. IRAKM deletion (Irakm(-/-)) exacerbated tMCAO-induced neurovascular injuries, and aggravated neuroinflammatory response. Moreover, KD pretreatment or BHB post-treatment lost their neuroprotection in the tMCAO-treated Irakm(-/-) mice.

The mechanism by which KBs influence visceral white adipose tissue physiology is only partially known, and our study aimed to shed light on the effects they exert on such tissue. To this aim, we administered 1,3-butanediol (BD) to rats since it rapidly enhances beta-hydroxybutyrate serum levels, and we evaluated the effect it induces within 3 h or after 14 days of treatment. After 14 days of treatment, rats showed a decrease in body weight gain, energy intake, gonadal-WAT (gWAT) weight, and adipocyte size compared to the control. BD exerted a pronounced antioxidant effect and directed redox homeostasis toward reductive stress, already evident within 3 h after its administration. BD lowered tissue ROS levels and oxidative damage to lipids and proteins and enhanced tissue soluble and enzymatic antioxidant capacity as well as nuclear erythroid factor-2 protein levels.

We show that esophageal epithelial cells and macrophage-derived NLRP3 regulated IL-18 initiate the disease and induced IL-5 facilitates eosinophil growth and survival. We also found that A. fumigatus-exposed IL-18(-/-) mice or IL-18-neutralized mice are protected from EoE induction. Most importantly, we present that intravascular rIL-18 delivery to DeltadblGATA mice and CD2-IL-5 mice show the development of EoE characteristics feature like degranulated and intraepithelial eosinophils, basal cell hyperplasia, remodeling and fibrosis. Similarly, we show an induced NLRP3-caspase1-regulated IL-18 pathway is also operational in human EoE. Lastly, we present the evidence that inhibitors of NLRP3 and caspase-1 (MCC950, BHB, and VX-765) protect A. fumigatus- and corn-extract-induced EoE pathogenesis. In conclusion, the current study provides a new understanding by implicating NLRP3/caspase1-regulated IL-18 pathway in EoE pathogenesis.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors can reduce body weight, increase diuresis, and play a protective role in heart failure. We examined the complementary effects of dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, and lobeglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. We treated HFD-induced obese mice with vehicle, dapagliflozin, lobeglitazone, and their combination for 12 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests were performed after 12-week treatment, and body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry before and after treatment. We analyzed oxygen consumption rate (OCR) using 3T3-L1 cells after treatment of beta-hydroxybutyrate and/or lobeglitazone. Treatment with a combination of dapagliflozin and lobeglitazone resulted in a significant decrease in postprandial hyperglycemia compared with dapagliflozin monotherapy, but not compared with lobeglitazone monotherapy. The addition of dapagliflozin to lobeglitazone treatment did not attenuate weight gain compared with lobeglitazone monotherapy in this study. However, this combination prevented the increase of organ weight of liver and heart, and OCR in 3T3-L1 cells was increased after treatment with a combination of beta-hydroxybutyrate and lobeglitazone compared to lobeglitazone monotherapy. We confirmed the beneficial effect of lobeglitazone on glucose metabolism; however, we did not find any beneficial effect of dapagliflozin on body weight in HFD-induced obese mice.

37575059,Acute Ingestion of a Ketone Monoester without Co-ingestion of Carbohydrate Improves Running Economy in Male Endurance Runners.,"PURPOSE: Acute ingestion of a ketone monoester, with and without co-ingestion of carbohydrate, was investigated for effects on running economy (RE), time to exhaustion (TTE), and other related indices of endurance running performance. METHODS: Using a three condition, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design, 11 male middle- and long-distance runners ran at five submaximal speeds (10-14 km.h -1 ) on a motorized treadmill for 8 min each, immediately followed by a ramp test to volitional exhaustion. Participants consumed either a 10% carbohydrate solution (CHO), a 10% carbohydrate solution with 750 mg.kg -1 body mass of an ( R )-3-hydroxybutyl ( R )-3-hydroxybutyrate ketone monoester (CHO + KE), or 750 mg.kg -1 body mass of the ketone monoester in flavored water (KE) before (two-thirds of the dose) and during (one-third of the dose) exercise. RESULTS: beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration averaged 1.8 +/- 0.3 and 2.1 +/- 0.3 mM during exercise in CHO + KE and KE, respectively. RE was lower at each submaximal running speed (effect size = 0.48-0.98) by an average of 4.1% in KE compared with CHO, but not between CHO + KE and CHO. TTE did not differ between CHO (369 +/- 116 s), CHO + KE (342 +/- 99 s), or KE (333 +/- 106 s) ( P = 0.093). CONCLUSIONS: Acute ingestion of a ketone monoester without carbohydrate, but not when coingested with carbohydrate, improved RE in middle- and long-distance runners at a range of submaximal running speeds and did not alter TTE in a short-duration ramp test to volitional exhaustion.

37662316,Ketone ester administration improves glycemia in obese mice.,"During periods of prolonged fasting/starvation, the liver generates ketones [i.e., beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB)] that primarily serve as alternative substrates for ATP production. Previous studies have demonstrated that elevations in skeletal muscle ketone oxidation contribute to obesity-related hyperglycemia, whereas inhibition of succinyl CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT), the rate-limiting enzyme of ketone oxidation, can alleviate obesity-related hyperglycemia. As circulating ketone levels are a key determinant of ketone oxidation rates, we tested the hypothesis that increases in circulating ketone levels would worsen glucose homeostasis secondary to increases in muscle ketone oxidation. Accordingly, male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to high-fat diet-induced obesity, whereas their lean counterparts received a standard chow diet. Lean and obese mice were orally administered either a ketone ester (KE) or placebo, followed by a glucose tolerance test. In tandem, we conducted isolated islet perifusion experiments to quantify insulin secretion in response to ketones. We observed that exogenous KE administration robustly increases circulating betaOHB levels, which was associated with an improvement in glucose tolerance only in obese mice. These observations were independent of muscle ketone oxidation, as they were replicated in mice with a skeletal muscle-specific SCOT deficiency. Furthermore, the R-isomer of betaOHB produced greater increases in perifusion insulin levels versus the S-isomer in isolated islets from obese mice. Taken together, acute elevations in circulating ketones promote glucose-lowering in obesity. Given that only the R-isomer of betaOHB is oxidized, further studies are warranted to delineate the precise role of beta-cell ketone oxidation in regulating insulin secretion.NEW & NOTEWORTHY It has been demonstrated that increased skeletal muscle ketone metabolism contributes to obesity-related hyperglycemia. Since increases in ketone supply are key determinants of organ ketone oxidation rates, we determined whether acute elevations in circulating ketones following administration of an oral ketone ester may worsen glucose homeostasis in lean or obese mice. Our work demonstrates the opposite, as acute elevations in circulating ketones improved glucose tolerance in obese mice.",0,mouse,animal,Animal – Mouse,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,brain,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Insulin resistance,Metabolic & Endocrine,"long-term potentiation (LTP), up; axonal conduction, up; synchronization, up","Learning, up; Axonal conduction, up; Synchronization, up",exogenous KB D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-betaHb),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

The most abundant ketone metabolite, 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHBUT), has been suggested to prevent or delay cognitive impairment, but the evidence remains unclear. We triangulated observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies to investigate the association and causation between KBs and cognitive function. METHODS: In observational analyses of 5506 participants aged >/= 45 years from the Whitehall II study, we used multiple linear regression to investigate the associations between categorized KBs and cognitive function scores. Two-sample MR was carried out using summary statistics from an in-house KBs meta-analysis between the University College London-London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine-Edinburgh-Bristol (UCLEB) Consortium and Kettunen et al. (N = 45,031), and publicly available summary statistics of cognitive performance and Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium (N = 257,841), and the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (N = 54,162), respectively. Both strong (P < 5 x 10(-8)) and suggestive (P < 1 x 10(-5)) sets of instrumental variables for BOHBUT were applied. Finally, we performed cis-MR on OXCT1, a well-known gene for KB catabolism. RESULTS: BOHBUT was positively associated with general cognitive function (beta = 0.26, P = 9.74 x 10(-3)). In MR analyses, we observed a protective effect of BOHBUT on cognitive performance (inverse variance weighted: beta(IVW) = 7.89 x 10(-2), P(IVW) = 1.03 x 10(-2); weighted median: beta(W-Median) = 8.65 x 10(-2), P(W-Median) = 9.60 x 10(-3)) and a protective effect on AD (beta(IVW) = - 0.31, odds ratio: OR = 0.74, P(IVW) = 3.06 x 10(-2)). Cis-MR showed little evidence of therapeutic modulation of OXCT1 on cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Triangulation of evidence suggests that BOHBUT has a beneficial effect on cognitive performance.

However its active mechanism has not been revealed. Herein, we probed both the pathways and brain regions involved in BHB's antidepressant-like effects in a learned helplessness (LH) rat model of depression. A single bilateral infusion of BHB into the cerebral ventricles induced the antidepressant-like effects on the LH rats.

Our previous study has found that sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1 (SMCT1), a key enzyme in charge of ketone reabsorption, possesses beneficial effects on the function of renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) in energy crisis. Our present study is to investigate whether SMCT1 is important in maintaining the physiological function of renal tubular and plays a role in DKD. METHODS: We tested the expression of SMCT1 in kidney tissues from DKD patients receiving kidney biopsy as well as diabetes mice. We compared the difference of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) levels in serum, urine and kidney tissues between diabetic mice and control. Using recombinant adeno-associated viral vector containing SMCT1 (encoded by Slc5a8 gene), we tested the effect of SMCT1 upregulation on microalbuminuria as well as its effects on mitochondrial energy metabolism in diabetic mice. Then we investigated the role of SMCT1 and its beta-HB reabsorption function in maintaining the physiological function of renal tubular using renal tubule-specific Slc5a8 gene knockout mice. Transcriptomes and proteomics analysis were used to explore the underlying mechanism. RESULTS: SMCT1 downregulation was found in DKD patients as well as in diabetic mice. Moreover, diabetic mice had a decreased renal beta-HB level compared with control, and SMCT1 upregulation could improve microalbuminuria and mitochondrial energy metabolism. In renal tubule-specific Slc5a8 gene knockout mice, microalbuminuria occurred early at 24 weeks of age, accompanied by ATP shortage and metabolic reprogramming in the kidney; however, supplementation with beta-HB precursor substance 1,3-butanediol in food alleviated kidney damage as well as energy metabolic reprogramming. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased SMCT1 expression and its ketone reabsorption function play an important role in the occurrence of DKD.

37748369,Short-term fasting of mice elevates circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23).,"AIMS: Phosphate and vitamin D homeostasis are controlled by fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) from bone suppressing renal phosphate transport and enhancing 24-hydroxylase (Cyp24a1), thereby inactivating 1,25(OH)(2) D(3) . Serum FGF23 is correlated with outcomes in several diseases. Fasting stimulates the production of ketone bodies. We hypothesized that fasting can induce FGF23 synthesis through the production of ketone bodies. METHODS: UMR106 cells and isolated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) were treated with ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate. Mice were fasted overnight, fed ad libitum, or treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate. Proteins and further blood parameters were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), western blotting, immunohistochemistry, fluorometric or colorimetric methods, and gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: beta-Hydroxybutyrate stimulated FGF23 production in UMR106 cells in a nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B-cells (NFkappaB)-dependent manner, and in NRVMs. Compared to fed animals, fasted mice exhibited higher beta-hydroxybutyrate and FGF23 serum levels (based on assays either detecting C-terminal or intact, biologically active FGF23 only), cardiac, pancreatic, and thymic Fgf23 and renal Cyp24a1 expression, and lower 1,25(OH)(2) D(3) serum concentration as well as renal Slc34a1 and alphaKlotho (Kl) expression. In contrast, Fgf23 expression in bone and serum phosphate, calcium, plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration, and renal Cyp27b1 expression were not significantly affected by fasting. CONCLUSION: Short-term fasting increased FGF23 production, as did administration of beta-hydroxybutyrate, effects possibly of clinical relevance in view of the increasing use of FGF23 as a surrogate parameter in clinical monitoring of diseases. The fasting state of patients might therefore affect FGF23 tests.",0,mouse preimplantation embryos; fetal placenta (gestational day 14.5); fetal liver (gestational day 14.5); fetal brain (gestational day 14.5),animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"gene expression perturbation, perturbed",Other / Unspecified,placenta,Placenta/Decidua,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",2 mmol/l betaOHB; Keto (betaOHB + 0.8 mmol/l AcAc),In vitro media supplementation; Multi-source,NS

DESIGN: Blastocysts cultured in vitro with or without 2 mmol/l betaOHB alone ('betaOHB') or combined with 0.8 mmol/l AcAc ('Keto') underwent embryo transfer. Transcriptional profiles of sexed placenta, liver and brain at gestational day 14.5 were examined via RNA sequencing and DAVID functional analysis. RESULTS: A sexually dimorphic response to in vitro ketone exposure was observed. Both betaOHB and Keto exposure down-regulated genes related to oxidative phosphorylation specifically in female liver. betaOHB down-regulated female placental steroid biosynthetic processes, while Keto treatment up-regulated genes relevant to blood vessel formation and cell migration in male placenta. Brain transcriptomes were minimally affected. X-linked genes and chromatin modifiers were identified as differentially expressed in both liver and placenta, alluding to a sex-specific regulatory mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Transient preimplantation ketone exposure perturbs sex-specific fetal liver and placental gene expression, demonstrating a developmental programming effect that warrants future investigation of the postnatal metabolic health of male and female offspring.",0,WorldTour cyclists,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"hyperketonaemia, up",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"8-min TT performance, up","Exercise capacity, up",ketone monoester (KE) 800 mg/kg,Ketone ester (KE),NS

Twenty-eight cyclists participated in the study (27.46 +/- 4.32 years; 1.80 +/- 0.06 m; 69.74 +/- 6.36 kg). Performance, physiological, biochemical, and metabolism outcomes, gut discomfort, and effort perceived were assessed during a road cycling simulation composed of an 8-min time-trial (TT) performance + 30-s TT + 4.5 hr of outdoor cycling + a second 8-min TT + a second 30-s TT. Greater absolute and relative mean power during the first 8-min TT (F = 5.067, p = .033, etap2=.163, F = 5.339, p = .029, etap2=.170, respectively) was observed after KE than after PL (KE: 389 +/- 34, PL: 378 +/- 44 W, p = .002, d = 0.294 and KE: 5.60 +/- 0.42, PL: 5.41 +/- 0.44 W/kg, p = .001, d = 0.442). Additionally, greater concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate blood concentration (F = 42.195, p < .001, etap2=.619) was observed after KE than after PL during the first steps of the stage (e.g., after warm-up KE: 1.223 +/- 0.642, PL: 0.044 +/- 0.058 mM, p < .001, d = 2.589), although the concentrations returned to near baseline after 4.5 hr of outdoor cycling. Moreover, higher values of anion gap were observed (F = 2.333, p = .026, etap2=.080) after KE than after PL ingestion, after the warm-up and after the first 8-min and 30-s TT. Additionally, lower concentrations of HCO3- were reported in the KE condition after warm-up and after the first 8-min and 30-s TT. During the initial phase of the stage simulation, acute supplementation with KE + NaHCO3 co-ingestion enhanced 8-min TT cycling performance (3.1%) in WorldTour cyclists with a concomitant hyperketonaemia.",0,human cardiac specimens from patients with postischemic heart failure; healthy control subjects; murine model of HF; cellular systems,human; animal; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Animal – Mouse; NS,"maladaptive chromatin remodeling, down",Epigenetic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Heart failure,Cardiovascular,"mitochondrial dysfunction, down","Mitochondrial function, down",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

However, the exact molecular processes underlying this disorder are not fully known. This study includes a comprehensive and coordinated set of in vivo and in vitro experiments using human cardiac specimens from patients with postischemic heart failure (HF) and healthy control subjects, a murine model of HF, and cellular systems. These approaches identified for the first time a specific pattern of maladaptive chromatin remodeling, namely a double methylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 and a single methylation at lysine 36 (H3_K27me2K36me1) consistently induced by ischemic injury in all these settings: human HF; murine HF; and in vitro models. Mechanistically, this work demonstrates that this histone modification mediates the ischemia-induced transcriptional repression of PPARG coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha), master regulator of mitochondrial function and biogenesis. Intriguingly, both the augmented H3_K27me2K36me1 and the mitochondrial dysfunction ensued by PGC1alpha down-regulation were significantly attenuated by the treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate, the most abundant ketone body in humans, revealing a novel pathway coupling metabolism to gene expression. Taken together, these findings establish maladaptive chromatin remodeling as a key mechanism in postischemic heart injury, functionally modulated by ketone bodies.",0,5 AUD participants; 5 healthy control (HC) participants,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"ketone metabolism, up",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alcohol use disorder,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"alcohol craving, down","Alcohol craving, down",single-dose ketone ester (KE) supplement,Ketone ester (KE),NS

This shift in energy utilization persists beyond acute intoxication in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD), and may contribute to alcohol craving. We recently found that ketone therapies decrease alcohol withdrawal and alcohol craving in AUD. Here, we studied the effects of a single-dose ketone ester (KE) supplement on brain energy metabolism and alcohol craving. Five AUD and five healthy control (HC) participants underwent two (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scans, after consumption of 395 mg/kg KE or without (baseline), in randomized order. In the AUD group, KE reduced alcohol craving scores compared to baseline. KE decreased blood glucose levels and elevated blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels compared to baseline in both groups. Whole-brain voxel-wise maps of the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) decreased by 17% in both groups, with the largest KE-induced CMRglc reductions in the frontal, occipital, and cingulate cortices, hippocampus, amygdala, and insula. There were no group differences between AUD and HC in blood or FDG measures, and no correlations between reductions in craving with CMRglc. Cingulate BHB levels, as assessed with (1) H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 5 participant with AUD, increased 3-fold with KE compared to baseleline. In sum, administration of a single dose of KE rapidly shifted brain energetics from glucose to ketone metabolism in HC and AUD. KE also reduced ratings of alcohol craving, demonstrating its potential clinical effectiveness for supporting brain health and alcohol craving in AUD.",0,Langendorff rat heart,animal,Multi-model,"ketone utilization, up",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Ischemia-reperfusion injury,Injury & Trauma,"left ventricular-developed pressure, up","Cardiac function, up",4 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHb),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Several non-canonical mechanisms have been proposed to explain these cardiac effects, including increasing circulating ketone supply to the heart. This study aims to test whether EMPA directly alters cardiac ketone metabolism independent of supply. METHODS AND RESULTS: The direct effects of EMPA on cardiac function and metabolomics were investigated in Langendorff rat heart perfused with buffer containing 5 mM glucose, 4 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHb) and 0.4 mM intralipid, subject to low flow ischaemia/reperfusion. Cardiac energetics were monitored in situ using 31P NMR spectroscopy. Steady-state 13C labelling was performed by switching 12C substrates for 13C1 glucose or 13C4 betaHb and 13C incorporation into metabolites determined using 2D 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectroscopy. EMPA treatment improved left ventricular-developed pressure during ischaemia and reperfusion compared to vehicle-treated hearts. In EMPA-treated hearts, total adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr) levels, and Gibbs free energy for ATP hydrolysis were significantly higher during ischaemia and reperfusion. EMPA treatment did not alter the incorporation of 13C from glucose into glycolytic products lactate or alanine neither during ischaemia nor reperfusion. In ischaemia, EMPA led to a decrease in 13C1 glucose incorporation and a concurrent increase in 13C4 betaHb incorporation into tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates succinate, citrate, and glutamate. During reperfusion, the concentration of metabolites originating from 13C1 glucose was similar to vehicle but those originating from 13C4 betaHb remained elevated in EMPA-treated hearts. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that EMPA causes a switch in metabolism away from glucose oxidation towards increased ketone utilization in the rat heart, thereby improving function and energetics both during ischaemia and recovery during reperfusion. This preference of ketone utilization over glucose was observed under conditions of constant supply of substrate, suggesting that EMPA acts directly by modulating cardiac substrate preference, independent of substrate availability. The mechanisms underlying our findings are currently unknown, warranting further study.",NLRP3; GSDMD; CASP1; IL1B; IL18; CASP3; MPO; NFKB1; IL6; TNF; ROS1; 0; BECN1; SQSTM1; TJP1; OCLN; CLDN5,DSS-induced ulcerative colitis in rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis, down",Multiple mechanisms,colon,Large intestine/Colon,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Ulcerative colitis,Autoimmune & Inflammatory,"disease activity, down","Disease activity index (DAI), down",exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate; ketogenic diet (KD),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid); Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage.

It is unclear how LEAP2 is influenced by fasting and how it responds to specific nutrients. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this investigation was to assess whether LEAP2 concentration 1) decreases after fasting, 2) increases postprandially, and 3) is regulated by nutrient sensing in the splanchnic bed. METHODS: Plasma LEAP2 concentration was measured in blood samples from 5 clinical cross-over trials, following 1) 36 h of fasting (n = 8), 2) 10 h of fasting (n = 37, baseline data pooled from 4 of the clinical trials), 3) Oral and intravenous glucose administration (n = 11), 4) Oral and intravenous Na-lactate administration (n = 10), and 5) Oral and intravenous Na-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) administration (n = 8). All 5 trials included healthy males. RESULTS: Compared with a 10-h fasting period, the median LEAP2 concentration was 38% lower following 36 h of fasting (P < 0.001). Oral administration of glucose elevated, whereas intravenous glucose administration lowered LEAP2 concentration (intervention x time, P = 0.001), resulting in a mean difference of 9 ng/mL (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1, 17) after 120 min. Oral lactate increased, and intravenous lactate decreased LEAP2 (intervention x time, P = 0.007), with a mean difference between interventions of 10 ng/mL (95% CI: 6, 15) after 120 min. In contrast, oral and intravenous administration of BHB reduced the LEAP2 concentration (main effect of time, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our investigations show that LEAP2 concentration was lower after a 36-h fast than an overnight fast and that oral delivery of glucose and lactate elevated LEAP2 concentration compared with intravenous administration, whereas LEAP2 concentrations decreased with both oral and intravenous BHB. This indicates that the LEAP2 concentration is sensitive to intestinal exposure to specific substrates, highlighting the need for future studies exploring the relationship between nutrients and LEAP2.

37881851,The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate shifts microglial metabolism and suppresses amyloid-beta oligomer-induced inflammation in human microglia.,"Fatty acids are metabolized by beta-oxidation within the ""mitochondrial ketogenic pathway"" (MKP) to generate beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body. BHB can be generated by most cells but largely by hepatocytes following exercise, fasting, or ketogenic diet consumption. BHB has been shown to modulate systemic and brain inflammation; however, its direct effects on microglia have been little studied. We investigated the impact of BHB on Abeta oligomer (AbetaO)-stimulated human iPS-derived microglia (hiMG), a model relevant to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). HiMG responded to AbetaO with proinflammatory activation, which was mitigated by BHB at physiological concentrations of 0.1-2 mM. AbetaO stimulated glycolytic transcripts, suppressed genes in the beta-oxidation pathway, and induced over-expression of AD-relevant p46Shc, an endogenous inhibitor of thiolase, actions that are expected to suppress MKP. AbetaO also triggered mitochondrial Ca(2+) increase, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, and activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. BHB potently ameliorated all the above mitochondrial changes and rectified the MKP, resulting in reduced inflammasome activation and recovery of the phagocytotic function impaired by AbetaO. These results indicate that microglia MKP can be induced to modulate microglia immunometabolism, and that BHB can remedy ""keto-deficiency"" resulting from MKP suppression and shift microglia away from proinflammatory mitochondrial metabolism. These effects of BHB may contribute to the beneficial effects of ketogenic diet intervention in aged mice and in human subjects with mild AD.",0,young healthy volunteers,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"cardiac chronotropy, up",Hormonal Regulation,left ventricle,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cardiac output, up","Cardiac output, up",oral ketone ester,Ketone ester (KE),NS

However, the extent to which this increase in cardiac output is related to changes in cardiac contractility, and dependent on the presence of heart failure, remains incompletely understood. Therefore, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of oral ketone ester in young healthy volunteers. Baseline cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed and repeated every 15 min for 60 min after ketone and placebo ingestion to assess changes in left ventricular function. As expected, circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate increased rapidly after ketone ingestion, but did not change with placebo (interaction: P < 0.001). Consistent with prior investigations, ketone ingestion resulted in an average 1 L/min increase in cardiac output after 60 min that did not occur with placebo (interaction: P = 0.026). This increase in cardiac output was primarily driven by an increase in heart rate after ketone ingestion (interaction: P = 0.018), with only a modest increase in stroke volume (interaction: P = 0.037). Changes in left ventricular strain and twist mechanics were limited. Taken together, the increase in cardiac output following an acute elevation in circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate is primarily driven by changes in cardiac chronotropy, with minimal inotropic contribution.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of oral ketone ester in young healthy volunteers, we show a marked increase in cardiac output ( approximately 1 L/min), driven primarily by changes in chronotropy.

Previously, it has been demonstrated in male animals that exogenous ketone supplement-evoked ketosis can decrease anxiety levels in preclinical rodent models, such as Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats. Thus, in this study, we investigated whether intragastric gavage of the exogenous ketone supplement KEMCT (mix of 1,3-butanediol-acetoacetate diester/ketone ester/KE and medium-chain triglyceride/MCT oil in 1:1 ratio) for 7 days can alter the anxiety levels of female WAG/Rij rats using the light-dark box (LDB) test. We demonstrated that a lower dose of KEMCT (3 g/kg/day) increased blood R-betaHB (R-beta-hydroxybutyrate) levels and significantly decreased anxiety levels (e.g., increased the time spent in the light compartment) in female WAG/Rij rats on the seventh day of administration. Although the higher KEMCT dose (5 g/kg/day) increased blood R-betaHB levels more effectively, compared with the lower KEMCT dose, anxiety levels did not improve significantly. We conclude that ketone supplementation might be an effective strategy to induce anxiolytic effects not only in male but also in female WAG/Rij rats. However, these results suggest that the optimal level may be moderately, not highly, elevated blood R-betaHB levels when the goal is to alleviate symptoms of anxiety.

37945565,The dentate gyrus differentially metabolizes glucose and alternative fuels during rest and stimulation.,"The metabolic demands of neuronal activity are both temporally and spatially dynamic, and neurons are particularly sensitive to disruptions in fuel and oxygen supply. Glucose is considered an obligate fuel for supporting brain metabolism. Although alternative fuels are often available, the extent of their contribution to central carbon metabolism remains debated. Differential fuel metabolism likely depends on cell type, location, and activity state, complicating its study. While biosensors provide excellent spatial and temporal information, they are limited to observations of only a few metabolites. On the other hand, mass spectrometry is rich in chemical information, but traditionally relies on cell culture or homogenized tissue samples. Here, we use mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) to focus on the fuel metabolism of the dentate granule cell (DGC) layer in murine hippocampal slices. Using stable isotopes, we explore labeling dynamics at baseline, as well as in response to brief stimulation or fuel competition. We find that at rest, glucose is the predominant fuel metabolized through glycolysis, with little to no measurable contribution from glycerol or fructose. However, lactate/pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), octanoate, and glutamine can contribute to TCA metabolism to varying degrees. In response to brief depolarization with 50 mM KCl, glucose metabolism was preferentially increased relative to the metabolism of alternative fuels. With an increased supply of alternative fuels, both lactate/pyruvate and betaHB can outcompete glucose for TCA cycle entry. While lactate/pyruvate modestly reduced glucose contribution to glycolysis, betaHB caused little change in glycolysis. This approach achieves broad metabolite coverage from a spatially defined region of physiological tissue, in which metabolic states are rapidly preserved following experimental manipulation. Using this powerful methodology, we investigated metabolism within the dentate gyrus not only at rest, but also in response to the energetic demand of activation, and in states of fuel competition.",0,77 ST-elevation MI (STEMI) patients; eight nonhuman primates (ischemia/reperfusion model); gnotobiotic mice; HMGCS2-deficient mice,human; animal,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Animal – Other Mammal; Animal – Mouse,"beta-hydroxybutyrate production, up",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Myocardial infarction,Cardiovascular,"cardiac function, up","Cardiac function, up",produced by inoculated gut butyrate-producing bacteria,NS,NS

Our analysis identified an enriched population of butyrate-producing bacteria. These findings were then validated using a controlled ischemia/reperfusion model using eight nonhuman primates. To elucidate mechanisms, we inoculated gnotobiotic mice with these bacteria and found that they can produce beta-hydroxybutyrate, supporting cardiac function post-MI. This was further confirmed using HMGCS2-deficient mice which lack endogenous ketogenesis and have poor outcomes after MI. Inoculation increased plasma ketone levels and provided significant improvements in cardiac function post-MI.

The main ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), is the primary energy substrate endogenously produced in a ketogenic diet, however, mechanisms of its therapeutic actions remain unknown. Here, we studied the effects of BHB on mitochondrial energetics, both in non-stimulated conditions and during glutamate-mediated hyperexcitation. We found that glutamate-induced hyperexcitation stimulated mitochondrial respiration in cultured cortical neurons, and that this response was greater in cultures supplemented with BHB than with glucose. BHB enabled a stronger and more sustained maximal uncoupled respiration, indicating that BHB enables neurons to respond more efficiently to increased energy demands such as induced during hyperexcitation. We found that cytosolic Ca(2+) was required for BHB-mediated enhancement of mitochondrial function, and that this enhancement was independent of the mitochondrial glutamate-aspartate carrier, Aralar/AGC1. Our results suggest that BHB exerts its protective effects against hyperexcitation by enhancing mitochondrial function through a Ca(2+)-dependent, but Aralar/AGC1-independent stimulation of mitochondrial respiration.",0,EAE mouse model of multiple sclerosis; transgenic mice unable to produce betaHB in the intestine; L. murinus strain,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Other Mammal,"gut microbiota shaping, NS",Other / Unspecified,intestine,Gastrointestinal (unspecified segment),T helper 17 (Th17) cells,Hematopoietic / Immune,T cells,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,Autoimmune & Inflammatory,"EAE severity, down","Disease activity index (DAI), down",Dietary supplementation,NS,NS

A KD rescued the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis in a microbiota-dependent fashion. Dietary supplementation with a single KD-dependent host metabolite (beta-hydroxybutyrate, betaHB) rescued EAE whereas transgenic mice unable to produce betaHB in the intestine developed more severe disease. Transplantation of the betaHB-shaped gut microbiota was protective. Lactobacillus sequence variants were associated with decreased T helper 17 (Th17) cell activation in vitro . Finally, we isolated a L. murinus strain that protected from EAE, which was phenocopied by the Lactobacillus metabolite indole lactic acid.

37979443,Higher beta-hydroxybutyrate ketone levels associated with a slower kidney function decline in ADPKD.,"BACKGROUND: Dysregulated energy metabolism is a recently discovered key feature of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Cystic cells depend on glucose and are poorly able to use other energy sources such as ketone bodies. Raising ketone body concentration reduced disease progression in animal models of polycystic kidney diseases. Therefore, we hypothesized that higher endogenous plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations are associated with reduced disease progression in patients with ADPKD. METHODS: We analyzed data from 670 patients with ADPKD participating in the Developing Intervention Strategies to Halt Progression of ADPKD (DIPAK) cohort, a multi-center prospective observational cohort study. BHB was measured at baseline using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Participants were excluded if they had type 2 diabetes, were using disease-modifying drugs (e.g. tolvaptan, somatostatin analogs), were not fasting or had missing BHB levels, leaving 521 participants for the analyses. Linear regression analyses were used to study cross-sectional associations and linear mixed-effect modeling for longitudinal associations. RESULTS: Of the participants, 61% were female, with an age of 47.3 +/- 11.8 years, a height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) of 834 [interquartile range (IQR) 495-1327] mL/m and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 63.3 +/- 28.9 mL/min/1.73 m2. The median concentration of BHB was 94 (IQR 68-147) micromol/L. Cross-sectionally, BHB was associated neither with eGFR nor with htTKV. Longitudinally, BHB was positively associated with eGFR slope B = 0.35 mL/min/1.73 m2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.61], P = .007, but not with kidney growth. After adjustment for potential confounders, every doubling in BHB concentration was associated with an improvement in the annual rate of eGFR by 0.33 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.57, P = .008).

38012969,beta-hydroxybutyrate administered at reperfusion reduces infarct size and preserves cardiac function by improving mitochondrial function through autophagy in male mice.,"Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury after revascularization contributes approximately 50% of infarct size and causes heart failure, for which no established clinical treatment exists. beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), which serves as both an energy source and a signaling molecule, has recently been reported to be cardioprotective when administered immediately before I/R and continuously after reperfusion. This study aims to determine whether administering beta-OHB at the time of reperfusion with a single dose can alleviate I/R injury and, if so, to define the mechanisms involved. We found plasma beta-OHB levels were elevated during ischemia in STEMI patients, albeit not to myocardial protection level, and decreased after revascularization. In mice, compared with normal saline, beta-OHB administrated at reperfusion reduced infarct size (by 50%) and preserved cardiac function, as well as activated autophagy and preserved mtDNA levels in the border zone. Our treatment with one dose beta-OHB reached a level achievable with fasting and strenuous physical activity. In neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) subjected to I/R, beta-OHB at physiologic level reduced cell death, increased autophagy, preserved mitochondrial mass, function, and membrane potential, in addition to attenuating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. ATG7 knockdown/knockout abolished the protective effects of beta-OHB observed both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, beta-OHB's cardioprotective effects were associated with inhibition of mTOR signaling. In conclusion, beta-OHB, when administered at reperfusion, reduces infarct size and maintains mitochondrial homeostasis by increasing autophagic flux (potentially through mTOR inhibition). Since beta-OHB has been safely tested in heart failure patients, it may be a viable therapeutic to reduce infarct size in STEMI patients.",SLC25A5; PPARG,ethanol-fed mice; ethanol-exposed hepatocytes,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells,"protein lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,liver,Liver,hepatocytes,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Alcoholic liver disease,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"liver lipid accumulation, up","Hepatic triglycerides, up",ketogenesis-derived,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

However, the mechanism underlining the physiological effects of ketone accumulation in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is still in its infancy. Here, we discovered that mitochondrial acetyl-CoA accumulation was diverted into the ketogenesis pathway in ethanol-fed mice and ethanol-exposed hepatocytes. Unexpectedly, global protein lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) was induced in response to increased ketogenesis-derived beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels both in hepatocytes and in livers of mice. Focusing on the solute carrier family (SLCs), we found that SLC25A5 presented obvious Kbhb at lysine residues 147 and 166. Kbhb modifications at these two lysine residues stabilized SLC25A5 expression by blocking ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Subsequent mutation analysis revealed that Kbhb of SLC25A5 at K147 and K166 had site-specific regulatory roles by increasing peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) expression, which further promoting lipogenesis. Additionally, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 2 (HMGCS2), a rate-limiting enzyme for BHB production, was profoundly induced by ethanol exposure, and knockout of Hmgcs2 with CRISPR/Cas9 attenuated SLC25A5 Kbhb. Together, our study demonstrated a widespread Kbhb landscape under ethanol exposure and clarified a physiological effect of Kbhb modification on liver lipid accumulation.",0,NS,NS,NS,"HDAC-catalyzed beta-hydroxybutyrylation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",starvation and low carbohydrate diets,Fasting / Caloric restriction (endogenous),NS
38015723,Reversible histone deacetylase activity catalyzes lysine acylation.,"Starvation and low carbohydrate diets lead to the accumulation of the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), whose blood concentrations increase more than 10-fold into the millimolar range. In addition to providing a carbon source, BHB accumulation triggers lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) of proteins via unknown mechanisms. As with other lysine acylation events, Kbhb marks can be removed by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Here, we report that class I HDACs unexpectedly catalyze protein lysine modification with beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Mutational analyses of the HDAC2 active site reveal a shared reliance on key amino acids for classical deacetylation and non-canonical HDAC-catalyzed beta-hydroxybutyrylation. Also consistent with reverse HDAC activity, Kbhb formation is driven by mass action and substrate availability. This reverse HDAC activity is not limited to BHB but also extends to multiple short-chain fatty acids. The reversible activity of class I HDACs described here represents a novel mechanism of PTM deposition relevant to metabolically-sensitive proteome modifications.",BDH1; NFE2L2,DKD mouse models; C57 BKS db/db mice; patients with diabetes; HK-2 cells (high glucose- or palmitic acid-induced),animal; human; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Human – Observational/Patient samples; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"BDH1-mediated betaOHB metabolic flux (enhancing betaOHB-acetoacetate-succinate-fumarate), up",Metabolic Regulation,kidney,Kidney,human renal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetic kidney disease,Renal & Urological,"fibrosis, reversed; inflammation, reversed; apoptosis, reversed; DKD progression, reversed","Fibrosis, reversed; Inflammation, reversed; Apoptosis, reversed; Disease progression, reversed",betaOHB treatment; betaOHB supplementation; KD feeding,NS; Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid); Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

In this study, we examined the BDH1-mediated betaOHB metabolic pathway in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). We found that BDH1 is downregulated in the kidneys in DKD mouse models, patients with diabetes, and high glucose- or palmitic acid-induced human renal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells. BDH1 overexpression or betaOHB treatment protects HK-2 cells from glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity by inhibiting reactive oxygen species overproduction. Mechanistically, BDH1-mediated betaOHB metabolism activates NRF2 by enhancing the metabolic flux of betaOHB-acetoacetate-succinate-fumarate. Moreover, in vivo studies showed that adeno-associated virus 9-mediated BDH1 renal expression successfully reverses fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis in the kidneys of C57 BKS db/db mice. Either betaOHB supplementation or KD feeding could elevate the renal expression of BDH1 and reverse the progression of DKD.

METHODS: Using a two condition, placebo-controlled, double-blinded and crossover design, 12 trained females (mean +/- SD: age, 23 +/- 3 yr; height, 1.64 +/- 0.08 m; mass, 65.2 +/- 12.7 kg) completed a baseline assessment of cognitive performance (psychomotor vigilance testing (PVT), task switching, and incongruent flanker), followed by 6 x 5-min intervals at 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, and 65% of their maximal power output (W max ) and then a 10-km time trial, concluding with the same assessments of cognitive performance. Participants consumed either 375 mg.kg -1 body mass of KME with a 6% CHO solution (1 g.min -1 of exercise) or CHO alone, across three boluses (50:25:25). RESULTS: Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations averaged 1.80 +/- 0.07 and 0.13 +/- 0.01 mM during exercise in KME + CHO and CHO, respectively. Blood glucose decreased after drink 1 of KME + CHO (~15%; P = 0.01) but not CHO, and lactate concentrations were lower in KME + CHO at 50%, 55%, 60%, and 65% W max (all P < 0.05) compared with CHO. Despite these changes, no differences were found between conditions for time trial finishing times (KME + CHO, 29.7 +/- 5.7 min; CHO, 29.6 +/- 5.7 min; P = 0.92). However, only KME + CHO resulted in increases in psychomotor vigilance testing speed (~4%; P = 0.01) and faster reaction times (~14%; P < 0.01), speed (~15%; P < 0.01), and correct responses (~13%; P = 0.03) in the incongruent flanker during posttesting compared with CHO. CONCLUSIONS: The acute ingestion of a KME + CHO elevated blood beta-hydroxybutyrate and lowered glucose and lactate across multiple time points during exercise compared with CHO.

38095025,Ketone bodies in right ventricular failure: A unique therapeutic opportunity.,"BACKGROUND: Ketone bodies are pleotropic metabolites that play important roles in multiple biological processes ranging from bioenergetics to inflammation regulation via suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and epigenetic modifications. Ketone bodies are elevated in left ventricular failure (LVF) and multiple approaches that increase ketone concentrations exert advantageous cardiac effects in rodents and humans. However, the relationships between ketone bodies and right ventricular failure (RVF) are relatively unexplored. METHODS: 51 PAH patients were dichotomized into preserved or impaired RV function based on a cardiac index of 2.2 L/min/m(2). Impaired RV function patients were further segmented into intermediate or severe RV dysfunction based on a right atrial pressure of 8 mm Hg. Serum ketone bodies acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) were quantified using ultra performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. In rodent studies, male Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to three groups: control (saline injection), monocrotaline (MCT) standard chow diet (MCT-Standard), and MCT ketogenic diet (MCT-Keto). Immunoblots and confocal microscopy probed macrophage NLRP3 activation in RV extracts and sections. RV fibrosis was determined by Picrosirus Red. Echocardiography evaluated RV function. Pulmonary arteriole remodeling was assessed from histological specimens. RESULTS: Human RVF patients lacked a compensatory ketosis as serum AcAc and betaOHB levels were not associated with hemodynamic, echocardiographic, or biochemical measures of RV dysfunction. In rodent studies, AcAc and betaOHB levels were also not elevated in MCT-mediated RVF, but the ketogenic diet significantly increased AcAc and betaOHB levels. MCT-Keto exhibited suppressed NLRP3 activation with a reduction in NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein), pro-caspase-1, and interleukin-1 beta on immunoblots. Moreover, the number of ASC-positive macrophage in RV sections was reduced, RV fibrosis was blunted, and RV function was augmented in MCT-Keto rats. CONCLUSION: The ketogenic response is blunted in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients with RVF. In the MCT rat model of PAH-mediated RVF, a dietary-induced ketosis improves RV function, suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and combats RV fibrosis. The summation of these data suggest ketogenic therapies may be particularly efficacious in RVF, and therefore future studies evaluating ketogenic interventions in human RVF are warranted.",0,Juvenile Cy/+ rats; adult rats; mouse; cat,animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Mouse; Animal – Other Mammal,"creatinine and citrate excretion increase, up",Multiple mechanisms,kidney,Kidney,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Polycystic kidney disease,Genetic / Congenital,"cyst formation and expansion, down","Cyst formation, down",water containing titrated BHB,Drinking water / Diet admixture,NS
38106091,A combination of beta-hydroxybutyrate and citrate ameliorates disease progression in a rat model of polycystic kidney disease.,"Our research has shown that interventions producing a state of ketosis are highly effective in rat, mouse, and cat models of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), preventing and partially reversing cyst growth and disease progression. The ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) appears to underlie this effect. In addition, we have demonstrated that naturally formed microcrystals within kidney tubules trigger a renoprotective response that facilitates tubular obstruction clearance in healthy animals but, alternatively, leads to cyst formation in PKD. The administration of citrate prevents microcrystal formation and slows PKD progression. Juvenile Cy/+ rats, a nonorthologous PKD model, were supplemented from 3 to 8 wk of age with water containing titrated BHB, citrate, or in combination to find minimal effective and optimal dosages, respectively. Adult rats were given a reduced BHB/citrate combination or equimolar control K/NaCl salts from 8 to 12 wk of age. In addition, adult rats were placed in metabolic cages following BHB, citrate, and BHB/citrate administration to determine the impact on mineral, creatinine, and citrate excretion. BHB or citrate alone effectively ameliorates disease progression in juvenile rats, decreasing markers of cystic disease and, in combination, producing a synergistic effect. BHB/citrate leads to partial disease regression in adult rats with established cystic disease, inhibiting cyst formation and kidney injury. BHB/citrate confers benefits via multiple mechanisms, increases creatinine and citrate excretion, and normalizes mineral excretion. BHB and citrate are widely available and generally recognized as safe compounds and, in combination, exhibit high promise for supporting kidney health in polycystic kidney disease.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Combining beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and citrate effectively slows and prevents cyst formation and expansion in young Cy/+ rats using less BHB and citrate than when used alone, demonstrating synergy. In adult rats, the combination causes a partial reversal of existing disease, reducing cyst number and cystic area, preserving glomerular health, and decreasing markers of kidney injury. Our results suggest a safe and feasible strategy for supporting kidney health in polycystic kidney disease (PKD) using a combination of BHB and citrate.",BDH1; INS,82-week case report; ten studies with a 20-hour UF on three non-consecutive days (4:3-NC),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"BHB elicitation, down",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"weight loss rate, down; fat loss rate, down","Body weight, down; Body fat mass, down",NS,NS,NS
38106160,Effects of duration of uninterrupted fast in weekly intermittent fasting: Comparison of an 82-week 5:2 case report to an isocaloric modified 4:3 protocol.,"Intermittent fasting (IF) approach for weight loss obviates the inconvenience of calorie counting of daily caloric restriction (DCR). It tests IF ability to better counteract a metabolic defense mechanism (MDM) than DCR. MDM obstructs weight loss and facilitates weight regain possibly by increasing hunger and efficiency of exercise energy expenditure (EEf), and by reducing resting metabolic rate (RMR) and physical activity (PA). A knowledge gap exists about whether the duration of weekly uninterrupted fasts (UFs), where the IF protocols are isocaloric, mitigate the MDM. This study compares two IF protocols that have the same weekly number of hours of fast (108) and free access to food (60), but which differ in the duration of UF. An 82-week case report was conducted with twice-weekly near-absolute 36-hour fasts on non-consecutive days (5:2-NC) and compared to ten studies with a 20-hour UF on three non-consecutive days (4:3-NC) modified through provision of a 500-600 kcal meal on fasting days. The large meal raised insulin concentration for 4 hours and reduced the UF to 8 hours followed by 12 nocturnal hours of fasting. The hypotheses were that (1) because of their matched F/E ratio, the rates of weight and fat losses will be similar in both protocols, and (2) because of its longer UF period, hunger will be higher and RMR and voluntary physical activity lower, in 5:8-NC than in M4:3-NC protocol,. The main differences between the two protocols were, (1) slower rates of weight and fat losses, (2) lower sensation of hunger and substantial decline in fullness, no change in RMR and physical activity, and 2.5 times higher post-fast concentration of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in 8:2-NC compared to M4:3-NC protocol. Absence of increased hunger and the variability of the rate of weight loss in 5:2-NC protocol, plus increased EEf in one M4:3-NC study suggest that IF does not curtail MDM, but shortened UF period in M4:3-NC reduces elicitation of BHB. Thus, the addition of a large meal on fasting days is unnecessary for prevention of hunger and is counterproductive for increases in BHB and its potential health benefits.",MTOR; 0; LITAF; NLRP3; HCAR2,aging KD-treated mouse cohort; 12-month-old male mice fed one-week and one-year cyclic KD; primary human microglia; primary human astrocytes; primary human neurons; primary mouse microglia; bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs),animal; in vitro; human,Multi-model; Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells,"inhibition of LPS-induced inflammatory gene activation, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,brain,Brain/CNS,microglia,Neural / Glial,Microglia,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Neuroinflammation,Autoimmune & Inflammatory,"neuroinflammation, down","Neuroinflammation, down",cyclic ketogenic diet (KD),Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
38176626,A ketogenic diet reduces age-induced chronic neuroinflammation in mice Running title: ketogenic diet and brain inflammaging.,"Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a ketone body synthesized during fasting or strenuous exercise. Our previous study demonstrated that a cyclic ketogenic diet (KD), which induces BHB levels similar to fasting every other week, reduces midlife mortality and improves memory in aging mice. BHB actively regulates gene expression and inflammatory activation through non-energetic signaling pathways. Neither of these activities has been well-characterized in the brain and they may represent mechanisms by which BHB affects brain function during aging. First, we analyzed hepatic gene expression in an aging KD-treated mouse cohort using bulk RNA-seq. In addition to the downregulation of TOR pathway activity, cyclic KD reduces inflammatory gene expression in the liver. We observed via flow cytometry that KD also modulates age-related systemic T cell functions. Next, we investigated whether BHB affects brain cells transcriptionally in vitro. Gene expression analysis in primary human brain cells (microglia, astrocytes, neurons) using RNA-seq shows that BHB causes a mild level of inflammation in all three cell types. However, BHB inhibits the more pronounced LPS-induced inflammatory gene activation in microglia. Furthermore, we confirmed that BHB similarly reduces LPS-induced inflammation in primary mouse microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). BHB is recognized as an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC), an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome, and an agonist of the GPCR Hcar2. Nevertheless, in microglia, BHB's anti-inflammatory effects are independent of these known mechanisms. Finally, we examined the brain gene expression of 12-month-old male mice fed with one-week and one-year cyclic KD. While a one-week KD increases inflammatory signaling, a one-year cyclic KD reduces neuroinflammation induced by aging. In summary, our findings demonstrate that BHB mitigates the microglial response to inflammatory stimuli, like LPS, possibly leading to decreased chronic inflammation in the brain after long-term KD treatment in aging mice.",IL6; CCL2; CCL3; TNF,ApoE (-/-) mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"systemic inflammation, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,aorta,Vasculature,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Atherosclerosis,Cardiovascular,"atherosclerosis progression, down","Atherosclerosis progression, down",ketogenic diet (KD),Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

We investigated a very high-fat KD's vascular impact and plasma metabolic signature compared to a non-ketogenic high-fat diet (HFD). Apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE (-/-)) mice were fed a KD (%kcal:81:1:18, fat/carbohydrate/protein), a non-ketogenic high-fat diet with half of the fat content (HFD) (%kcal:40:42:18, fat/carbohydrate/protein) for 12 weeks. Plasma samples were used to quantify the major ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, and TNF alpha), and to targeted metabolomic profiling by mass spectrometry. In addition, aortic atherosclerotic lesions were quantified ex-vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a 14-tesla system. KD was atherogenic when compared to the control diet, but KD mice, when compared to the HFD group (1) had markedly higher levels of BHB and lower levels of cytokines, confirming the presence of ketosis that alleviated the well-established fat-induced systemic inflammation; (2) displayed significant changes in the plasma metabolome that included a decrease in lipophilic metabolites and an increase in hydrophilic metabolites; (3) had significantly lower levels of several atherogenic lipid metabolites, including phosphatidylcholines, cholesterol esters, sphingomyelins, and ceramides; and (4) presented significantly lower aortic plaque burden.

38190779,Ketone bodies promote epididymal white adipose expansion to alleviate liver steatosis in response to a ketogenic diet.,"Liver can sense the nutrient status and send signals to other organs to regulate overall metabolic homoeostasis. Herein, we demonstrate that ketone bodies act as signals released from the liver that specifically determine the distribution of excess lipid in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) when exposed to a ketogenic diet (KD). An acute KD can immediately result in excess lipid deposition in the liver. Subsequently, the liver sends the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) to regulate white adipose expansion, including adipogenesis and lipogenesis, to alleviate hepatic lipid accumulation. When ketone bodies are depleted by deleting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 gene in the liver, the enhanced lipid deposition in eWAT but not in inguinal white adipose tissue is preferentially blocked, while lipid accumulation in liver is not alleviated. Mechanistically, ketone body BHB can significantly decrease lysine acetylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in eWAT, causing enhanced activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, the key adipogenic transcription factor. These observations suggest that the liver senses metabolic stress first and sends a corresponding signal, that is, ketone body BHB, to specifically promote eWAT expansion to adapt to metabolic challenges.",0,male C57BL/6J mice; high-fat diet+streptozotocin-induced DKD model,animal,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Other Mammal,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,kidney,Kidney,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetic kidney disease,Renal & Urological,"kidney morphology and function, no-change","Kidney function, no-change",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

AIM: To investigate the impact of long-term canagliflozin treatment on DKD and elucidate its underlying mechanism. METHODS: DKD model was established using high-fat diet and streptozotocin in male C57BL/6J mice (n = 30). Mice were divided into five groups and treated for 12 weeks. 1) normal control mice, 2) DKD model, 3) mice treated low-dose of canagliflozin, 4) high-dose of canagliflozin and 5) beta-hydroxybutyrate. Mice kidney morphology and function were evaluated, and a metabolomics analysis was performed. RESULTS: Canagliflozin treatment reduced blood creatinine and urine nitrogen levels and improved systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in diabetic mice. Additionally, a decrease in histological lesions including collagen and lipid deposition in the kidneys was observed. beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment did not yield a comparable outcome. The metabolomics analysis revealed that canagliflozin induced alterations in amino acid metabolism profiles in the renal tissue of diabetic mice. CONCLUSION: Canagliflozin protects the kidneys of diabetic mice by increasing the levels of essential amino acids, promoting mitochondrial homeostasis, mitigating oxidative stress, and stimulating the amino acid-dependent tricarboxylic acid cycle.",IL1B; TNF; IL6; IL1RN; IL10; IFNG; CCL2,overnight-fasted adults at risk for T2D; adults with T2D; LPS-stimulated leukocytes (ex vivo),human; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Multi-model,"inflammatory signalling inhibition, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,blood,Blood,leukocytes,Unspecified / Mixed,Mixed cell population,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Type 2 diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"inflammation, down","Inflammation, down",ex vivo BHB; ketone monoester supplementation (KME),NS; Ketone ester (KE),NS

Therefore, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of BHB in humans across three clinical trials. To investigate if BHB suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, we treated LPS-stimulated leukocytes from overnight-fasted adults at risk for T2D with BHB (Study 1). Next (Study 2), we investigated if exogenously raising BHB acutely in vivo by ketone monoester supplementation (KME) in adults with T2D would suppress pro-inflammatory plasma cytokines. In Study 3, we investigated the effect of BHB on inflammation via ex vivo treatment of LPS-stimulated leukocytes with BHB and in vivo thrice-daily pre-meal KME for 14 days in adults with T2D. Ex vivo treatment with BHB suppressed LPS-stimulated IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 secretion and increased IL-1RA and IL-10 (Study 1). Plasma IL-10 increased by 90 min following ingestion of a single dose of KME in T2D, which corresponded to peak blood BHB (Study 2). Finally, 14 days of thrice-daily KME ingestion did not significantly alter plasma cytokines or leukocyte subsets including monocyte and T-cell polarization (Study 3). However, direct treatment of leukocytes with BHB modulated TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, and MCP-1 secretion in a time- and glucose-dependent manner (Study 3). Therefore, BHB appears to be anti-inflammatory in T2D, but this effect is transient and is modulated by the presence of disease, glycaemia, and exposure time.",RELA; 0; CASP3,mouse model of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury,animal,Animal – Mouse,"suppression of inflammation, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,kidney,Kidney,tubular cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Acute kidney injury,Renal & Urological,"tubular damage score, down; serum creatinine, down","Kidney function, down; Serum creatinine, down",intraperitoneal administration of exogenous beta-HB,Intraperitoneal BHB,NS

Recent studies have highlighted the renoprotective effects of exogenous beta-HB therapy in various animal models of kidney disease. In this investigation, our goal was to assess whether pre-treatment with exogenous beta-HB could alleviate kidney damage in a mouse model of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Prior to cisplatin administration, intraperitoneal administration of beta-HB was carried out, and the groups were classified into four: Sham, beta-HB, cisplatin, and beta-HB + cisplatin. The tubular damage score and serum creatinine levels were significantly lower in the beta-HB + cisplatin group compared to the cisplatin group. Furthermore, the expression of phosphorylated NF-kappaB, inflammatory cytokines, and the quantity of F4/80-positive macrophages in the beta-HB + cisplatin group were reduced compared to those in the cisplatin group. Additionally, oxidative stress markers for DNA, protein, and lipid in the beta-HB + cisplatin group were markedly diminished compared to those in the cisplatin group. The number of TUNEL-positive and cleaved caspase 3-positive tubular cells in the beta-HB + cisplatin group was lower than in the cisplatin group.

Whether orally ingested exogenous ketones can stimulate postprandial myofibrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) rates with and without dietary protein co-ingestion is unknown. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ketone monoester intake and elevated blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) concentration, with and without dietary protein co-ingestion, on postprandial MyoPS rates and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway signaling. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, parallel group design, 36 recreationally active healthy young males (age: 24.2 +/- 4.1 y; body fat: 20.9% +/- 5.8%; body mass index: 23.4 +/- 2 kg/m(2)) received a primed continuous infusion of L-[ring-(2)H(5)]-phenylalanine and ingested one of the following: 1) the ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (KET), 2) 10 g whey protein (PRO), or 3) the combination of both (KET+PRO). Blood and muscle biopsy samples were collected during basal and postprandial (300 min) conditions to assess beta-OHB, glucose, insulin, and amino acid concentrations, MyoPS rates, and mTORC1 pathway signaling. RESULTS: Capillary blood beta-OHB concentration increased similarly during postprandial conditions in KET and KET+PRO, with both being greater than PRO from 30 to 180 min (treatment x time interaction: P < 0.001). Postprandial plasma leucine and essential amino acid (EAA) incremental area under the curve (iAUC) over 300 min was greater (treatment: both P < 0.001) in KET+PRO compared with PRO and KET. KET, PRO, and KET+PRO stimulated postprandial MyoPS rates (0-300 min) higher than basal conditions [absolute change: 0.020%/h; (95% CI: 0.013, 0.027%/h), 0.014%/h (95% CI: 0.009, 0.019%/h), 0.019%/h (95% CI: 0.014, 0.024%/h), respectively (time: P < 0.001)], with no difference between treatments (treatment: P = 0.383) or treatment x time interaction (interaction: P = 0.245). mTORC1 pathway signaling responses did not differ between treatments (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Acute oral intake of a ketone monoester, 10 g whey protein, or their co-ingestion in the overnight postabsorptive state elicit a similar stimulation of postprandial MyoPS rates in healthy young males.

38226418,Persistent Kv7.2/7.3 downregulation in the rat pilocarpine model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.,"Mutations within the Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 genes are well described causes for genetic childhood epilepsies. Knowledge on these channels in acquired focal epilepsy, especially in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), however, is scarce. Here, we used the rat pilocarpine model of drug-resistant mTLE to elucidate both expression and function by quantitative polymerase-chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and electrophysiology, respectively. We found transcriptional downregulation of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 as well as reduced Kv7.2 expression in epileptic CA1. Consequences were altered synaptic transmission, hyperexcitability which consisted of epileptiform afterpotentials, and increased susceptibility to acute GABAergic disinhibition. Importantly, blocking Kv7 channels with XE991 increased hyperexcitability in control tissue, but not in chronically epileptic tissue suggesting that the Kv7 deficit had precluded XE991 effects in this tissue. Conversely, XE991 resulted in comparable reduction of the paired-pulse ratio in both experimental groups implying preserved presynaptic Kv7.2 function of Schaffer collateral terminals. Consistent with Kv7.2/7.3 downregulation, the Kv7.3 channel opener beta-hydroxybutyrate failed to mitigate hyperexcitability. Our findings demonstrate that compromised Kv7 function is not only relevant in genetic epilepsy, but also in acquired focal epilepsy. Moreover, they help explain reduced anti-seizure efficacy of Kv7 channel openers in drug-resistant epilepsy.",TRPV4,human PAH patients; SuHx rats (Sugen/Hypoxia); SuHx-MVECs; rat MVECs; mouse MVECs,human; animal; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells; Animal – Mouse,"TRPV4 sensitization, up",Ion & Nutrient Transport,lung,Lung,microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs),Endothelial,Endothelial (unspecified),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hypertension,Cardiovascular,"NS, nan","NS, nan",BOHB supplementation,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
38242911,Fatty acid metabolism promotes TRPV4 activity in lung microvascular endothelial cells in pulmonary arterial hypertension.,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a morbid disease characterized by significant lung endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction. Prior work has shown that microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) isolated from animals with experimental PAH and patients with PAH exhibit significant abnormalities in metabolism and calcium signaling. With regards to metabolism, we and others have shown evidence of increased aerobic glycolysis and evidence of increased utilization of alternate fuel sources (such as fatty acids) in PAH EC. In the realm of calcium signaling, our prior work linked increased activity of the transient receptor potential vanilloid-4 (TRPV4) channel to increased proliferation of MVECs isolated from the Sugen/Hypoxia rat model of PAH (SuHx-MVECs). However, the relationship between metabolic shifts and calcium abnormalities was not clear. Specifically, whether shifts in metabolism were responsible for increasing TRPV4 channel activity in SuHx-MVECs was not known. In this study, using human data, serum samples from SuHx rats, and SuHx-MVECs, we describe the consequences of increased MVEC fatty acid oxidation in PAH. In human samples, we observed an increase in long-chain fatty acid levels that was associated with PAH severity. Next, using SuHx rats and SuHx-MVECs, we observed increased intracellular levels of lipids. We also show that increasing intracellular lipid content increases TRPV4 activity, whereas inhibiting fatty acid oxidation normalizes basal calcium levels in SuHx-MVECs. By exploring the fate of fatty acid-derived carbons, we observed that the metabolite linking increased intracellular lipids to TRPV4 activity was beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), a product of fatty acid oxidation. Finally, we show that BOHB supplementation alone is sufficient to sensitize the TRPV4 channel in rat and mouse MVECs. Returning to humans, we observe a transpulmonary BOHB gradient in human patients with PAH. Thus, we establish a link between fatty acid oxidation, BOHB production, and TRPV4 activity in MVECs in PAH. These data provide new insight into metabolic regulation of calcium signaling in lung MVECs in PAH.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this paper, we explore the link between metabolism and intracellular calcium levels in microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

38293164,AMPKalpha2 regulates fasting-induced hyperketonemia by suppressing SCOT ubiquitination and degradation.,"Ketone bodies serve as an energy source, especially in the absence of carbohydrates or in the extended exercise. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a crucial energy sensor that regulates lipid and glucose metabolism. However, whether AMPK regulates ketone metabolism in whole body is unclear even though AMPK regulates ketogenesis in liver. Prolonged resulted in a significant increase in blood and urine levels of ketone bodies in wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly, fasting AMPKalpha2(-/-) and AMPKalpha1(-/-) mice exhibited significantly higher levels of ketone bodies in both blood and urine compared to fasting WT mice. BHB tolerance assays revealed that both AMPKalpha2(-/-) and AMPKalpha1(-/-) mice exhibited slower ketone consumption compared to WT mice, as indicated by higher blood BHB or urine BHB levels in the AMPKalpha2(-/-) and AMPKalpha1(-/-) mice even after the peak. Interestingly, fasting AMPKalpha2(-/-) and AMPKalpha1(-/-) mice exhibited significantly higher levels of ketone bodies in both blood and urine compared to fasting WT mice. . Specifically, AMPKalpha2(DeltaMusc) mice showed approximately a twofold increase in blood BHB levels, and AMPKalpha2(DeltaMyo) mice exhibited a 1.5-fold increase compared to their WT littermates after a 48-h fasting. However, blood BHB levels in AMPKalpha1(DeltaMusc) and AMPKalpha1(DeltaMyo) mice were as same as in WT mice. Notably, AMPKalpha2(DeltaMusc) mice demonstrated a slower rate of BHB consumption in the BHB tolerance assay, whereas AMPKalpha1(DeltaMusc) mice did not show such an effect. Declining rates of body weights and blood glucoses were similar among all the mice. Protein levels of SCOT, the rate-limiting enzyme of ketolysis, decreased in skeletal muscle of AMPKalpha2(-/-) mice. Moreover, SCOT protein ubiquitination increased in C2C12 cells either transfected with kinase-dead AMPKalpha2 or subjected to AMPKalpha2 inhibition. AMPKalpha2 physiologically binds and stabilizes SCOT, which is dependent on AMPKalpha2 activity.",0,murine bone marrow macrophages (BMMs); T-REx293 cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"ordered membrane domain endocytosis (OMDE), down",Other / Unspecified,bone marrow,Bone marrow,bone marrow macrophages (BMMs),Hematopoietic / Immune,Macrophages,plasma membrane,Plasma Membrane,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
38311044,Constitutive Plasma Membrane Turnover in T-REx293 cells via Ordered Membrane Domain Endocytosis under Mitochondrial Control.,"Clathrin/dynamin-independent endocytosis of ordered plasma membrane domains (ordered membrane domain endocytosis, OMDE) can become massive in response to cytoplasmic Ca elevations, G protein activation by non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs, and enhanced oxidative metabolism. In patch-clamped murine bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), cytoplasmic succinate and pyruvate, but not beta-hydroxybutyrate, induce OMDE of 75% of the plasma membrane within 2 min. The responses require palmitoylation of membrane proteins, being decreased by 70% in BMMs lacking the acyltransferase, DHHC5, by treatment with carnitine to shift long-chain acyl groups from cytoplasmic to mitochondrial acyl-CoAs, by bromopalmitate/albumin complexes to block DHHCs, and by the mitochondria-specific cyclosporin, NIM811, to block permeability transition pores that may release mitochondrial coenzyme A into the cytoplasm. Using T-REx293 cells, OMDE amounts to 40% with succinate, pyruvate, or GTPgammaS, and it is inhibited by actin cytoskeleton disruption. Pyruvate-induced OMDE is blocked by the hydrophobic antioxidant, edaravone, which prevents permeability transition pore openings. Using fluorescent 3kD dextrans to monitor endocytosis, OMDE appears to be constitutively active in T-REx293 cells but not in BMMs. After 1 h without substrates or bicarbonate, pyruvate and hydroxybutyrate inhibit constitutive OMDE, as expected for a shift of CoA from long-chain acyl-CoAs to other CoA metabolites. In the presence of bicarbonate, pyruvate strongly enhances OMDE, which is then blocked by beta-hydroxybutyrate, bromopalmitate/albumin complexes, cyclosporines, or edaravone. After pyruvate responses, T-REx293 cells grow normally with no evidence for apoptosis. Fatty acid-free albumin (15 muM) inhibits basal OMDE in T-REx293 cells, as do cyclosporines, carnitine, and RhoA blockade. Surprisingly, OMDE in the absence of substrates and bicarbonate is not inhibited by siRNA knockdown of the acyltransferases, DHHC5 or DHHC2, which are required for activated OMDE in patch clamp experiments. We verify biochemically that small CoA metabolites decrease long-chain acyl-CoAs. We verify also that palmitoylations of many PM-associated proteins decrease and increase when OMDE is inhibited and stimulated, respectively, by different metabolites. STED microscopy reveals that vesicles formed during constitutive OMDE in T-REX293 cells have 90 to 130 nm diameters. In summary, OMDE is likely a major G-protein-dependent endocytic mechanism that can be constitutively active in some cell types, albeit not BMMs. OMDE depends on different DHHC acyltransferases in different circumstances and can be limited by local supplies of fatty acids, CoA, and long-chain acyl-CoAs.",CD68; P2RY12; IL1B; IL10; FOS,C57BL/6J male and female mice; human microglia (in vitro),animal; in vitro; human,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells,"pro-inflammatory factors, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,prefrontal cortex,Brain/CNS,microglia,Neural / Glial,Microglia,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"anxiety-like behavior, down; motor abilities, up","Anxiety-like behavior, down; Motor function, up",ketogenic diet (KD),Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

However, the sex-specific effects of KD on anxiety-like behavior in healthy individuals and the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these effects, including neuroinflammation, are unelucidated. This study investigated the sex-specific effects of KD on anxiety-like behavior and the neuroimmune response in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of healthy C57BL/6J male and female mice. Animals were fed either a control diet (CD- 17% fat, 65% carb, 18% protein) or a KD (80% fat, 5% carb, 15% protein) for 4 weeks. KD increased the levels of circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) both in males and females. However, PFC BHB levels were found to be elevated only in KD males. Moreover, KD did not affect the behavior of females but improved motor abilities and reduced anxiety levels in males. KD suppressed the mRNA expression of the pan microglial markers (Cd68, P2ry12) and induced morphological changes in the male PFC microglia. A sex-specific decrease in IL1beta and an increase in IL-10 levels was found in the PFC of KD males. A similar trend was observed in the hippocampus of males where KD reduced the mRNA expression of P2ry12, Il1beta, and cFos. Additionally, BHB increased the production of IL-10 whereas it decreased the production of IL1beta from human microglia in in-vitro conditions. In summary, these results demonstrate that the anxiolytic and motor function enhancement abilities of KD are male-specific. Reduced pro-inflammatory and improved anti-inflammatory factors in the male PFC and hippocampus may underlie these effects.",INS,healthy individuals (n=8),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"glucose tolerance, no-change","Glucose tolerance, no-change",ketone salts (38.7 g of beta-hydroxybutyrate/day),Multi-source,NS

The data were compared with the effects of endogenous ketonemia during both, a ketogenic diet or fasting. Eight healthy individuals [24.1 +/- 2.5 yr, body mass index (BMI) 24.3 +/- 3.1 kg/m(2)] participated in a crossover intervention study and were studied in a whole-room indirect calorimeter (WRIC) to assess macronutrient oxidation following four 24-h interventions: isocaloric controlled mixed diet (ISO), ISO supplemented with ketone salts (38.7 g of beta-hydroxybutyrate/day, EXO), isocaloric ketogenic diet (KETO), and total fasting (FAST). A physical activity level of 1.65 was obtained. In addition to plasma KB, 24-h C-peptide and KB excretion rates in the urine and postprandial glucose and insulin levels were measured. Although 24-h KB excretion increased in response to KETO and FAST, there was a modest increase in response to EXO only (P < 0.05). When compared with ISO, V̇o(2) significantly increased in KETO (P < 0.01) and EXO (P < 0.001), whereas there was no difference in FAST. V̇co(2) increased in EXO but decreased in KETO (both P < 0.01) and FAST (P < 0.001), resulting in 24-h respiratory exchange ratios (RER) of 0.828 +/- 0.024 (ISO) and 0.811 +/- 0.024 (EXO) (P < 0.05). In response to EXO there were no differences in basal and postprandial glucose and insulin levels, as well as in insulin sensitivity. When compared with ISO, EXO, and KETO, FAST increased homeostatic model assessment beta-cell function (HOMA-B) (all P < 0.05). In conclusion, at energy balance exogenous ketone salts decreased respiratory exchange ratio without affecting glucose tolerance.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our findings revealed that during isocaloric nutrition, additional exogenous ketone salts increased V̇o(2) and V̇co(2) while lowering the respiratory exchange ratio (RER).

38325337,Acute ketone supplementation in the absence of muscle glycogen utilization: Insights from McArdle disease.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Ketone supplementation is gaining popularity. Yet, its effects on exercise performance when muscle glycogen cannot be used remain to be determined. McArdle disease can provide insight into this question, as these patients are unable to obtain energy from muscle glycogen, presenting a severely impaired physical capacity. We therefore aimed to assess the effects of acute ketone supplementation in the absence of muscle glycogen utilization (McArdle disease). METHODS: In a randomized cross-over design, patients with an inherited block in muscle glycogen breakdown (i.e., McArdle disease, n = 8) and healthy controls (n = 7) underwent a submaximal (constant-load) test that was followed by a maximal ramp test, after the ingestion of a placebo or an exogenous ketone ester supplement (30 g of D-beta hydroxybutyrate/D 1,3 butanediol monoester). Patients were also assessed after carbohydrate (75 g) ingestion, which is currently considered best clinical practice in McArdle disease. RESULTS: Ketone supplementation induced ketosis in all participants (blood [ketones] = 3.7 +/- 0.9 mM) and modified some gas-exchange responses (notably increasing respiratory exchange ratio, especially in patients). Patients showed an impaired exercise capacity (-65 % peak power output (PPO) compared to controls, p < 0.001) and ketone supplementation resulted in a further impairment (-11.6 % vs. placebo, p = 0.001), with no effects in controls (p = 0.268). In patients, carbohydrate supplementation resulted in a higher PPO compared to ketones (+21.5 %, p = 0.001) and a similar response was observed vs. placebo (+12.6 %, p = 0.057). CONCLUSIONS: In individuals who cannot utilize muscle glycogen but have a preserved ability to oxidize blood-borne glucose and fat (McArdle disease), acute ketone supplementation impairs exercise capacity, whereas carbohydrate ingestion exerts the opposite, beneficial effect.",0,mice; mice with BDH1 deficiency in striated muscles,animal,Animal – Mouse,"mitochondrial bioenergetics, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,skeletal muscle and heart,Multi-tissue,striated muscle,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"fatty acid oxidation efficiency, up; exercise tolerance, up; lean mass, up; mitochondrial hormesis, up; metabolic rerouting of pyruvate, up","Fat oxidation, up; Exercise capacity, up; Lean mass, up; Mitochondrial hormesis, up; Metabolic rerouting, up",NS,NS,NS

This study questioned if the health benefits of an intermittent TRF (iTRF) schedule require ketone flux specifically in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Notably, we found that the ketolytic enzyme beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1) is uniquely enriched in isolated mitochondria derived from heart and red/oxidative skeletal muscles, which also have high capacity for fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Using mice with BDH1 deficiency in striated muscles, we discover that this enzyme optimizes FAO efficiency and exercise tolerance during acute fasting. Additionally, iTRF leads to robust molecular remodeling of muscle tissues, and muscle BDH1 flux does indeed play an essential role in conferring the full adaptive benefits of this regimen, including increased lean mass, mitochondrial hormesis, and metabolic rerouting of pyruvate. In sum, ketone flux enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics and supports iTRF-induced remodeling of skeletal muscle and heart.",AKT1; GSK3B; SLC2A4,HFD-induced insulin resistant mice; C2C12 myoblasts (palmitic acid-treated),animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"endoplasmic reticulum stress, down",General Stress Responses,skeletal muscle,Skeletal muscle,C2C12 myoblasts,Muscle – Skeletal,Myoblasts,endoplasmic reticulum,Endoplasmic Reticulum,Unspecified,Insulin resistance,Metabolic & Endocrine,"insulin sensitivity, up","Insulin sensitivity, up",beta-hydroxybutyric acid (beta-OHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

The present study sought to investigate whether a ketogenic diet also improves insulin sensitization in skeletal muscle cells through alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress. METHODS: High-fat diet-induced IR mice were allowed to a 2-week ketogenic diet. Insulin resistance and glucose tolerance were evaluated through GTT, ITT, and HOMA-IR. The C2C12 myoblasts exposed to palmitic acid were used to evaluate the insulin sensitization effects of beta-hydroxybutyric acid (beta-OHB). Molecular mechanisms concerning ER stress signaling activation and glucose uptake were assessed. RESULTS: The AKT/GSK3beta pathway was inhibited, ER stress signaling associated with IRE1, PERK, and BIP was activated, and the number of Glut4 proteins translocated to membrane decreased in the muscle of HFD mice. However, all these changes were reversed after 2 weeks of feeding on a ketogenic diet. Consistently in C2C12 myoblasts, the AKT/GSK3beta pathway was inhibited by palmitic acid (PA) treatment. The endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins, IRE1, and BIP were increased, and the number of Glut4 proteins on the cell membrane decreased. However, beta-OHB treatment alleviated ER stress and improved the glucose uptake of C2C12 cells. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that KD ameliorated HFD-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, which was partially mediated by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress. The insulin sensitization effect of beta-OHB is associated with up regulation of AKT/GSK3beta pathway and the increase in the number of Glut4 proteins on the cell membrane.",FOXP3,DSS-induced mouse colitis; RMAE preconditioning in mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"histone H3 acetylation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,colon,Large intestine/Colon,Treg cell,Hematopoietic / Immune,T cells,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Colitis,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"colitis severity, down","Colitis severity, down",a metabolite upon prolonged aerobic exercise,NS,NS

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one type of chronic inflammatory bowel disease with increasing incidence and prevalence worldwide. It is known that regular moderate aerobic exercise (RMAE) reduces the incidence or risk of UC, and attenuates disease progression in UC patients. However, the mechanisms of this RMAE's benefit are still under investigation. Here, we revealed that beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), a metabolite upon prolonged aerobic exercise, could contribute to RMAE preconditioning in retarding dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse colitis. When blocking beta-HB production, RMAE preconditioning-induced colitis amelioration was compromised, whereas supplementation of beta-HB significantly rescued impaired beta-HB production-associated defects. Meanwhile, we found that RMAE preconditioning significantly caused decreased colonic Th17/Treg ratio, which is considered to be important for colitis mitigation; and the downregulated Th17/Treg ratio was associated with beta-HB. We further demonstrated that beta-HB can directly promote the differentiation of Treg cell rather than inhibit Th17 cell generation. Furthermore, beta-HB increased forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3) expression, the core transcriptional factor for Treg cell, by enhancing histone H3 acetylation in the promoter and conserved noncoding sequences of the Foxp3 locus. In addition, fatty acid oxidation, the key metabolic pathway required for Treg cell differentiation, was enhanced by beta-HB treatment. Lastly, administration of beta-HB without exercise significantly boosted colonic Treg cell and alleviated colitis in mice. Together, we unveiled a previously unappreciated role for exercise metabolite beta-HB in the promotion of Treg cell generation and RMAE preconditioning-associated colitis attenuation.",HDAC1; HDAC2; SIRT4; GAD1; GLUD1,mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"H3K27 acetylation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,neuron,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Epilepsy,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"seizures, down","Seizure activity, down",KD-produced beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

However, the metabolic/cell biologic mechanisms by which the KD exerts its antiepileptic efficacy remain elusive. Herein, we report that KD-produced beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) augments brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the GABA/glutamate ratio to inhibit epilepsy. The KD ameliorated pentetrazol-induced epilepsy in mice. Mechanistically, KD-produced BHB, but not other ketone bodies, inhibited HDAC1/HDAC2, increased H3K27 acetylation, and transcriptionally upregulated SIRT4 and glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1). BHB-induced SIRT4 de-carbamylated and inactivated glutamate dehydrogenase to preserve glutamate for GABA synthesis, and GAD1 upregulation increased mouse brain GABA/glutamate ratio to inhibit neuron excitation. BHB administration in mice inhibited epilepsy induced by pentetrazol. BHB-mediated relief of epilepsy required high GABA level and GABA/glutamate ratio. These results identified BHB as the major antiepileptic metabolite of the KD and suggested that BHB may serve as an alternative and less toxic antiepileptic agent than KD.",0,large-scale GWAS,human,In silico / Computational,"mediation, up",Other / Unspecified,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Irritable bowel syndrome,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"IBS, up","Colitis severity, up",blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

We aimed to assess the causal effects of psychiatric disorders on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the potential mediators from a genetic perspective by conducting a Mendelian randomization (MR) study with mediation analysis. METHOD: Genetic instruments associated with psychiatric disorders, potential mediators, and IBS were obtained from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Three MR methods - the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, MR-Egger method, and weighted median method, were used to investigate causal association estimates. Heterogeneity among different genetic instrumental variables (IVs) was assessed using Q tests. Additionally, the MR-PRESSO and MR-Pleiotropy methods were used to verify horizontal pleiotropy and detect outliers that might bias the results, which were removed from further analysis. Consequently, we used MR mediation analysis to investigate potential mediators in the causal associations between psychiatric disorders and IBS. RESULTS: MR provided evidence of the causal effects of genetically predicted broad depression, major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and schizophrenia on IBS. The results of MR mediation analysis demonstrated that the reduction in acetate levels mediated 12.6% of the effects of broad depression on IBS; insomnia mediated 16.00%, 16.20%, and 27.14% of the effects of broad depression, MDD, and PTSD on IBS, respectively; and the increase in blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels mediated 50.76% of the effects of schizophrenia on IBS.

METHODS: We performed a spectral study to visualize the preventive effects of BHB on blood and multiorgan mitochondrial redox imbalance in T2DM mice via using label-free resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS), and further explored the impact of BHB therapy on the pathology of T2DM mice by histological and biochemical analyses. FINDINGS: Our data revealed that RRS-based mitochondrial redox states assay enabled clear and reliable identification of the improvement of mitochondrial redox imbalance by BHB, evidenced by the reduction of Raman peak intensity at 750 cm(-1), 1128 cm(-1) and 1585 cm(-1) in blood, tissue as well as purified mitochondria of db/db mice and the increase of tissue mitochondrial succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) staining after BHB treatment. Exogenous supplementation of BHB was also found to attenuate T2DM pathology related to mitochondrial redox states, involving organ injury, blood glucose control, insulin resistance and systemic inflammation.

Although D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) exhibits various protective effects, whether it affects the permeability of intestinal epithelium in systemic inflammation has not been clarified. In this study, we investigated the effects of BHB on the intestinal epithelial permeability, the epithelial marker E-cadherin and the tight junction protein Claudin-1 in colon in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation mouse model. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS was used to induce systemic inflammation and BHB was given by oral administration. The permeability of intestinal epithelium, the morphological changes of colonic epithelium, the distribution and generation of colon E-cadherin, and the Claudin-1 generation and its epithelial distribution in colon were detected. The results confirmed the intestinal epithelial hyperpermeability and inflammatory changes in colonic epithelium, with disturbed E-cadherin distribution in LPS-treated mice. Besides, colon Claudin-1 generation was decreased and its epithelial distribution in colon was weakened in LPS-treated mice. However, BHB treatments alleviated the LPS-induced hyperpermeability of intestinal epithelium, attenuated the colonic epithelial morphological changes and promoted orderly distribution of E-cadherin in colon. Furthermore, BHB up-regulated colon Claudin-1 generation and promoted its colonic epithelial distribution and content in LPS-treated mice. In conclusion, BHB may alleviate the hyperpermeability of intestinal epithelium via up-regulation of Claudin-1 in colon in LPS-treated mice.",0; INS,ten participants with type 2 diabetes,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"glucose absorption, down",Ion & Nutrient Transport,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Type 2 diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"postprandial glucose concentrations, down","Blood glucose, down",0.5 g/kg body mass ketone monoester (KME),Ketone ester (KE),NS

METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study, ten participants with type 2 diabetes (age 59+/-1.7 years, 50% female, BMI 32+/-1 kg/m(2), HbA(1c) 54+/-2 mmol/mol [7.1+/-0.2%]) were randomised using computer-generated random numbers. The study took place at the Nutritional Physiology Research Unit, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK. Using a dual-glucose tracer approach, we assessed glucose kinetics after the ingestion of a 0.5 g/kg body mass ketone monoester (KME) or a taste-matched non-caloric placebo before a mixed-meal tolerance test. The primary outcome measure was endogenous glucose production. Secondary outcome measures were total glucose appearance rate and exogenous glucose appearance rate, glucose disappearance rate, blood glucose, serum insulin, beta-OHB and NEFA levels, and energy expenditure. RESULTS: Data for all ten participants were analysed. KME ingestion increased mean +/- SEM plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate from 0.3+/-0.03 mmol/l to a peak of 4.3+/-1.2 mmol/l while reducing 2 h postprandial glucose concentrations by ~18% and 4 h postprandial glucose concentrations by ~12%, predominately as a result of a 28% decrease in the 2 h rate of glucose appearance following meal ingestion (all p<0.05). The reduction in blood glucose concentrations was associated with suppressed plasma NEFA concentrations after KME ingestion, with no difference in plasma insulin concentrations between the control and KME conditions. Postprandial endogenous glucose production was unaffected by KME ingestion (mean +/- SEM 0.76+/-0.15 and 0.88+/-0.10 mg kg(-1) min(-1) for the control and KME, respectively). No adverse effects of KME ingestion were observed. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: KME ingestion appears to delay glucose absorption in adults with type 2 diabetes, thereby reducing postprandial glucose concentrations. Future work to explore the therapeutic potential of KME supplementation in type 2 diabetes is warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05518448.

38587999,Elevation of hypothalamic ketone bodies induces a decrease in energy expenditures and an increase risk of metabolic disorder.,"OBJECTIVE: Ketone bodies (such as beta-hydroxybutyrate or BHB) have been recently proposed as signals involved in brain regulation of energy homeostasis and obesity development. However, the precise role of ketone bodies sensing by the brain, and its impact on metabolic disorder development remains unclear. Nevertheless, partial deletion of the ubiquitous ketone bodies transporter MCT1 in mice (HE mice) results in diet-induced obesity resistance, while there is no alteration under normal chow diet. These results suggest that ketone bodies produced during the high fat diet would be important signals involved in obesity onset. METHODS: In the present study we used a specific BHB infusion of the hypothalamus and analyzed the energy homeostasis of WT or HE mice fed a normal chow diet. RESULTS: Our results indicate that high BHB levels sensed by the hypothalamus disrupt the brain regulation of energy homeostasis. This brain control dysregulation leads to peripheral alterations of energy expenditure mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the changes induced by high ketone bodies levels sensed by the brain increase the risk of obesity onset in mice.",0,193 patients with any clinical indication for whole body [(18)F]-FDG-PET/CT,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,myocardium,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"adequate myocardial glucose metabolism suppression, up","Blood glucose, up",point-of-care device,NS,NS

METHODS AND RESULTS: We recruited 193 patients with any clinical indication for whole body [(18)F]-FDG-PET/CT. BHB level was measured with a point-of-care device. Maximal myocardial standardized uptake value using lean body mass (SULmax) was measured from eight circular regions of interest with 1 cm circumference and background from left ventricular blood pool. Correlations SULmax and point-of-care measured BHB were analysed. The ability of BHB test to predict adequate suppression was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic analysis. Liver and spleen attenuation in computed tomography were measured to assess the presence of fatty liver. BHB level correlated with myocardial uptake and, using a cut-off value of 0.35 mmol/L to predict adequate myocardial suppression, we reached specificity of 90% and sensitivity of 56%. Other variables to predict adequate suppression were diabetes, obesity, ketogenic diet and fatty liver. Using information attainable before imaging, we created a pretest probability calculator of inadequate myocardial glucose metabolism suppression. The area under the curve for BHB test alone was 0.802 and was 0.857 for the pretest calculator (p = 0.319). CONCLUSIONS: BHB level measured with a point-of-care device is useful in predicting adequate myocardial glucose metabolism suppression.

38604598,A maternal ketogenic diet alters oviduct fluid nutrients and embryo histone acetylation in mice.,"IN BRIEF: A ketogenic diet (KD) elevates blood beta-hydroxybutyrate to concentrations that are known to perturb the development, metabolism, histone acetylation and viability of preimplantation mouse embryos in culture. This study shows that a maternal KD changes available nutrient levels in the oviduct, leading to altered embryo development and epigenetic state in vivo. ABSTRACT: A ketogenic diet elevates blood beta-hydroxybutyrate to concentrations that perturb the development, metabolism, histone acetylation (H3K27ac) and viability of preimplantation mouse embryos in vitro. However, whether a ketogenic diet alters beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations within female reproductive fluid is unknown. This study aimed to quantify glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate within mouse blood and oviduct fluid following standard diet and ketogenic diet consumption and to assess whether a maternal periconceptional ketogenic diet impacts in vivo embryo development and blastocyst H3K27ac. Female C57BL/6 x CBA mice were fed a standard or ketogenic diet (n = 24 each) for 24-27 days. Glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate were quantified in blood via an electronic monitoring system and in oviduct fluid via ultramicrofluorescence. The developmental grade of flushed blastocysts was recorded, and blastocyst cell number and H3K27ac were assessed via immunofluorescence. A maternal ketogenic diet elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate in day 24 blood (P < 0.001) and oviduct fluid (P < 0.05) compared with a standard diet, whereas glucose was unchanged. A periconceptional ketogenic diet did not impact blastocyst cell number; however, it significantly delayed blastocyst development (P < 0.05) and reduced trophectoderm-specific H3K27ac (P < 0.05) compared with standard diet-derived embryos. Maternal ketogenic diet consumption is, therefore, associated with reproductive tract nutrient changes and altered embryonic development and epigenetics in vivo. Future studies to assess whether periconceptional/gestational ketogenic diet consumption impacts human preimplantation, fetal, and long-term offspring development and health are warranted.",0; PCK1,HFD-fed mice; ketogenic diet-fed mice; PPARalpha(-/-) mice; fasted PPARalpha(-/-) mice; proximal tubule cells; renal tubular cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Multi-model; In vitro – Primary cells,"C/EBPbeta-mediated transactivation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,kidney,Kidney,proximal tubule cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"blood glucose homeostasis, positive","Blood glucose, positive","1,3-butandiol (ketone diester); ketogenic diet; high-fat diet",Ketone ester (KE); Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
38612966,Hepatic ketone body regulation of renal gluconeogenesis.,"OBJECTIVES: During fasting, liver pivotally regulates blood glucose levels through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Kidney also produces glucose through gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenic genes are transactivated by fasting, but their expression patterns are chronologically different between the two organs. We find that renal gluconeogenic gene expressions are positively correlated with the blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration. Thus, we herein aim to investigate the regulatory mechanism and its physiological implications. METHODS: Gluconeogenic gene expressions in liver and kidney were examined in hyperketogenic mice such as high-fat diet (HFD)-fed and ketogenic diet-fed mice, and in hypoketogenic PPARalpha knockout (PPARalpha(-/-)) mice. Renal gluconeogenesis was evaluated by rise in glycemia after glutamine loading in vivo. Functional roles of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the regulation of renal gluconeogenesis were investigated by metabolome analysis and RNA-seq analysis of proximal tubule cells. RESULTS: Renal gluconeogenic genes were transactivated concurrently with blood beta-hydroxybutyrate uprise under ketogenic states, but the increase was blunted in hypoketogenic PPARalpha(-/-) mice. Administration of 1,3-butandiol, a ketone diester, transactivated renal gluconeogenic gene expression in fasted PPARalpha(-/-) mice. In addition, HFD-fed mice showed fasting hyperglycemia along with upregulated renal gluconeogenic gene expression, which was blunted in HFD-fed PPARalpha(-/-) mice. In vitro experiments and metabolome analysis in renal tubular cells showed that beta-hydroxybutyrate directly promotes glucose and NH(3) production through transactivating gluconeogenic genes. In addition, RNA-seq analysis revealed that beta-hydroxybutyrate-induced transactivation of Pck1 was mediated by C/EBPbeta. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that beta-hydroxybutyrate mediates hepato-renal interaction to maintain homeostatic regulation of blood glucose and systemic acid-base balance through renal gluconeogenesis regulation.",BDH1; 0; INS,recreationally active men (n=9),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration, up",Metabolic Regulation,muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"power output, no-change; time to complete time trial, no-change","Exercise capacity, no-change",ketone monoester (KME),Ketone ester (KE),NS

However, whether this strategy improves subsequent exercise performance is unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of ketone monoester (KME) followed by CHO ingestion after glycogen-lowering exercise on subsequent 20 km (TT(20km)) and 5 km (TT(5km)) best-effort time trials. Nine recreationally active men (175.6 +/- 5.3 cm, 72.9 +/- 7.7 kg, 28 +/- 5 y, 12.2 +/- 3.2% body fat, VO(2)max = 56.2 +/- 5.8 mL. kg BM(-1).min(-1); mean +/- SD) completed a glycogen-lowering exercise session, followed by 4 h of recovery and subsequent TT(20km) and TT(5km). During the first 2 h of recovery, participants ingested either KME (25 g) followed by CHO at a rate of 1.2 g.kg(-1).h(-1) (KME + CHO) or an iso-energetic placebo (dextrose) followed by CHO (PLAC + CHO). Blood metabolites during recovery and performance during the subsequent two-time trials were measured. In comparison to PLAC + CHO, KME + CHO displayed greater (p < 0.05) blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration during the first 2 h, lower (p < 0.05) blood glucose concentrations at 30 and 60 min, as well as greater (p < 0.05) blood insulin concentration 2 h following ingestion. However, no treatment differences (p > 0.05) in power output nor time to complete either time trial were observed vs. PLAC + CHO.

There are available supplements for inducing ketosis: ketone salts, ketone esters and medium-chain triglycerides. Even when all of them raise D-BHB in the blood and all are safe and well tolerated, they significantly differ in their safety profile, their palatability and their price. A fourth and potentially interesting option is to use biologically identical D-BHB, which it is already commercially available in the USA (American Ketone) and Greater China (MedPHA). However, its safety and tolerability had not yet been documented in the scientific literature. We evaluated the safety and tolerability of orally administered free D-BHB in a gender and age-balanced sample of 24 asymptomatic and overtly healthy adults. No participant showed acid-base abnormalities or electrolyte abnormalities. Secondary symptoms were reported after only 6.2% of all drink takes and none of the reports described the symptom as 'severe'. The most frequently reported secondary effects (19/720 or 2.6%) were gastrointestinal discomfort, headache (7/720 or 1%) and loss of appetite (7/720 or 1%). No correlation between weight-adjusted dose and frequency of secondary symptoms was observed. Free D-BHB was a safe and well-tolerated intervention for inducing sustained exogenous ketosis. Being bioidentical, salt-free and lacking intermediate metabolites, this form of supplementation could have a larger safety spectrum than salt or alcohol-based exogenous ketones. More research is warranted to assess its clinical efficacy in those clinical scenarios in which achieving ketosis rapidly could be beneficial.",0,mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"protein acylation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,liver,Liver,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,histone,Nucleus & Chromatin,Chromatin,Starvation,Metabolic & Endocrine,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketogenic diet,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
38653008,Protein acylations induced by a ketogenic diet demonstrate diverse patterns depending on organs and differ between histones and global proteins.,"An essential ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), plays various roles in physiological regulations via protein acylations such as lysine acetylation and beta-hydroxybutyrylation. Here, to understand how BOHB systemically regulates acylations from an overarching perspective, we administered a ketogenic diet to mice to increase BOHB concentration and examined acylations. We found that global acetylation and beta-hydroxybutyrylation dramatically increase in various organs except for the brains, where the increase was much smaller than in the other organs. Interestingly, we observe no increase in histone acetylation in the organs where significant global protein acetylation occurs despite a substantial rise in histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation. Finally, we compared the transcriptome data of the mice's liver after the ketogenic diet to the public databases, showing that upregulated genes are enriched in those related to histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation in starvation. Our data indicate that a ketogenic diet induces diverse patterns of acylations depending on organs and protein localizations, suggesting that different mechanisms regulate acylations and that the ketogenic diet is associated with starvation in terms of protein modifications.",0,satellite cells from ICU-acquired weakness patients; satellite cells from healthy volunteers/elective hip replacement patients,human; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Multi-model,"complex II function, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,vastus lateralis muscle,Skeletal muscle,satellite cells,Muscle – Skeletal,Satellite cells,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,ICU-acquired weakness,Musculoskeletal & Connective Tissue,"NS, nan","NS, nan",standard culture media supplemented with beta-OH-butyrate,In vitro media supplementation,NS

This study aimed to elucidate the distinct metabolic effects of critical illness and beta-OH-butyrate on satellite cells isolated from these patients. METHODS: Satellite cells were extracted from vastus lateralis muscle biopsies of patients with ICU-acquired weakness (n = 10) and control group of healthy volunteers or patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery (n = 10). The cells were exposed to standard culture media supplemented with beta-OH-butyrate to assess its influence on cell proliferation by ELISA, mitochondrial functions by extracellular flux analysis, electron transport chain complexes by high resolution respirometry, and ROS production by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Critical illness led to a decline in maximal respiratory capacity, ATP production and glycolytic capacity and increased ROS production in ICU patients' cells. Notably, the function of complex II was impaired due to critical illness but restored to normal levels upon exposure to beta-OH-butyrate. While beta-OH-butyrate significantly reduced ROS production in both control and ICU groups, it had no significant impact on global mitochondrial functions.

Adiposity is a noted modifiable metabolic risk factor for stroke, and recent research suggests that it benefits neurological rehabilitation. During the early phase of experimental stroke, the lipidomic results showed that fat depots underwent pronounced lipolysis and released fatty acids (FAs) that feed into consequent hepatic FA oxidation and ketogenesis. Systemic supplementation with the predominant ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is found to exert discernible effects on preserving blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and facilitating neuroinflammation resolution. Meanwhile, blocking FAO-ketogenesis processes by administration of CPT1alpha antagonist or shRNA targeting HMGCS2 exacerbated endothelial damage and aggravated stroke severity, whereas BHB supplementation blunted these injuries. Mechanistically, it is unveiled that BHB infusion is taken up by monocarboxylic acid transporter 1 (MCT1) specifically expressed in cerebral endothelium and upregulated the expression of tight junction protein ZO-1 by enhancing local beta-hydroxybutyrylation of H3K9 at the promoter of TJP1 gene. Conclusively, an adaptive metabolic mechanism is elucidated by which acute lipolysis stimulates FAO-ketogenesis processes to restore BBB integrity after stroke.

METHODS: This post hoc analysis of the EMMY trial investigated the changes in serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (3-betaOHB) levels after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in response to 26-week of Empagliflozin therapy compared to the usual post-MI treatment. In addition, the association of baseline and repeated measurements of 3-betaOHB with cardiac parameters and the interaction effects of Empagliflozin were investigated. Cardiac parameters included N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricle end-systolic volume (LVESV), left ventricle end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), and left ventricular filling pressure (E/e ratio). RESULTS: The mean 3-betaOHB levels increased from baseline (46.2 +/- 3.0 vs. 51.7 +/- 2.7) to 6 weeks (48.8 +/- 2.2 vs. 42.0 +/- 2.3) and 26 weeks (49.3 +/- 2.2 vs. 35.8 +/- 1.9) in the Empagliflozin group compared to a consistent decline in placebo over 26 weeks (p(interaction) < 0.001). Baseline and longitudinal measurements of 3-betaOHB were not significantly associated with NT-proBNP and E/e ratio. Baseline 3-betaOHB value was negatively associated with LVEF (coefficient: - 0.464, 95%CI - 0.863;- 0.065, p = 0.023), while an increase in its levels over time was positively associated with LVEF (0.595, 0.156;1.035, 0.008). The baseline 3-betaOHB was positively associated with LVESV (1.409, 0.186;2.632, 0.024) and LVEDV (0.640, - 1.170;- 2.449, 0.488), while an increase in its levels over time was negatively associated with these cardiac parameters (LVESV: - 2.099, - 3.443;- 0.755, 0.002; LVEDV: - 2.406, - 4.341;- 0.472, 0.015). Empagliflozin therapy appears to modify the association between 3-betaOHB, LVEF (p(interaction) = 0.090), LVESV (p(interaction) = 0.134), and LVEDV (p(interaction) = 0.168), particularly at 26 weeks; however, the results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This post hoc analysis showed that SGLT2i increased 3-betaOHB levels after AMI compared to placebo. Higher baseline 3-betaOHB levels were inversely associated with cardiac function at follow-up, whereas a sustained increase in 3-betaOHB levels over time improved these markers. This highlights the importance of investigating ketone body metabolism in different post-MI phases.

The present investigation aimed to determine the acute effects of ingesting a ketone monoester, whey protein, or their coingestion on mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-related protein-protein colocalization and intracellular trafficking in human skeletal muscle. In a randomized, double-blind, parallel group design, 36 healthy recreationally active young males (age: 24.2 +/- 4.1 yr) ingested either: 1) 0.36 g.kg(-1) bodyweight of the ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (KET), 2) 10 g whey protein (PRO), or 3) the combination of both (KET + PRO). Muscle biopsies were obtained in the overnight postabsorptive state (basal conditions), and at 120 and 300 min in the postprandial period for immunofluorescence assessment of protein translocation and colocalization of mTOR-related signaling molecules. All treatments resulted in a significant (Interaction: P < 0.0001) decrease in tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2)-Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) colocalization at 120 min versus basal; however, the decrease was sustained at 300 min versus basal (P < 0.0001) only in KET + PRO. PRO and KET + PRO increased (Interaction: P < 0.0001) mTOR-Rheb colocalization at 120 min versus basal; however, KET + PRO resulted in a sustained increase in mTOR-Rheb colocalization at 300 min that was greater than KET and PRO. Treatment intake increased mTOR-wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) colocalization at 120 and 300 min (Time: P = 0.0031), suggesting translocation toward the fiber periphery.

38708524,The ketogenic diet does not improve cardiac function and blunts glucose oxidation in ischaemic heart failure.,"AIMS: Cardiac energy metabolism is perturbed in ischaemic heart failure and is characterized by a shift from mitochondrial oxidative metabolism to glycolysis. Notably, the failing heart relies more on ketones for energy than a healthy heart, an adaptive mechanism that improves the energy-starved status of the failing heart. However, whether this can be implemented therapeutically remains unknown. Therefore, our aim was to determine if increasing ketone delivery to the heart via a ketogenic diet can improve the outcomes of heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: C57BL/6J male mice underwent either a sham surgery or permanent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation surgery to induce heart failure. After 2 weeks, mice were then treated with either a control diet or a ketogenic diet for 3 weeks. Transthoracic echocardiography was then carried out to assess in vivo cardiac function and structure. Finally, isolated working hearts from these mice were perfused with appropriately 3H or 14C labelled glucose (5 mM), palmitate (0.8 mM), and beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) (0.6 mM) to assess mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and glycolysis. Mice with heart failure exhibited a 56% drop in ejection fraction, which was not improved with a ketogenic diet feeding. Interestingly, mice fed a ketogenic diet had marked decreases in cardiac glucose oxidation rates. Despite increasing blood ketone levels, cardiac ketone oxidation rates did not increase, probably due to a decreased expression of key ketone oxidation enzymes. Furthermore, in mice on the ketogenic diet, no increase in overall cardiac energy production was observed, and instead, there was a shift to an increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation as a source of cardiac energy production. This resulted in a decrease in cardiac efficiency in heart failure mice fed a ketogenic diet. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the ketogenic diet does not improve heart function in failing hearts, due to ketogenic diet-induced excessive fatty acid oxidation in the ischaemic heart and a decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation.",SLC2A4,differentiated L6 myotubes,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"GLUT4 translocation, up",Multiple mechanisms,skeletal muscle,Skeletal muscle,L6 myotubes,Muscle – Skeletal,Myoblasts,membrane,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",racemic mixture of the two beta-hydroxybutyrate enantiomers (d and l); d-beta-hydroxybutyrate alone,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),racemic; D-BHB
38725863,Acetoacetate and d- and l-beta-hydroxybutyrate have distinct effects on basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in L6 skeletal muscle cells.,"Ketone bodies (acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate) are oxidized in skeletal muscle mainly during fasting as an alternative source of energy to glucose. Previous studies suggest that there is a negative relationship between increased muscle ketolysis and muscle glucose metabolism in mice with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we investigated the connection between increased ketone body exposure and muscle glucose metabolism by measuring the effect of a 3-h exposure to ketone bodies on glucose uptake in differentiated L6 myotubes. We showed that exposure to acetoacetate at a typical concentration (0.2 mM) resulted in increased basal glucose uptake in L6 myotubes, which was dependent on increased membrane glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation. Basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was also increased with a concentration of acetoacetate reflective of diabetic ketoacidosis or a ketogenic diet (1 mM). We found that beta-hydroxybutyrate had a variable effect on basal glucose uptake: a racemic mixture of the two beta-hydroxybutyrate enantiomers (d and l) appeared to decrease basal glucose uptake, while 3 mM d-beta-hydroxybutyrate alone increased basal glucose uptake. However, the effects of the ketone bodies individually were not observed when acetoacetate was present in combination with beta-hydroxybutyrate. These results provide insight that will help elucidate the effect of ketone bodies in the context of specific metabolic diseases and nutritional states (e.g., type 2 diabetes and ketogenic diets).NEW & NOTEWORTHY A limited number of studies investigate the effect of ketone bodies at concentrations reflective of both typical fasting and ketoacidosis. We tested a mix of physiologically relevant concentrations of ketone bodies, which allowed us to highlight the differential effects of d- and l-beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate on skeletal muscle cell glucose uptake. Our findings will assist in better understanding the mechanisms that contribute to muscle insulin resistance and provide guidance on recommendations regarding ketogenic diets.",0,NLRP3 knockout (KO) mice; wild-type (WT) mice; caspase 1/11 KO mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"pyroptosis, down",Cell Death & Survival,gut,Gastrointestinal (unspecified segment),muscularis resident macrophages (MMs),Hematopoietic / Immune,Macrophages,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"gut motility, up","Gut motility, up",Gut microbiota metabolites,NS,NS

Intestinal resident macrophages play an important role in this physiological function through protecting enteric neurons. However, it is incompletely clear how individuals maintain the homeostasis of gut motility. Here we found that NLRP3 is a critical factor in controlling loss of muscularis resident macrophages (MMs), and demonstrate that MMs are involved in the homeostasis of excitatory neurons such as choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)(+) and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2)(+) but not inhibitory neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)(+) neurons. NLRP3 knockout (KO) mice had enhanced gut motility and increased neurons, especially excitatory ChAT(+) and VGLUT2(+) neurons. Single cell analyses showed that there had increased resident macrophages, especially MMs in NLRP3 KO mice. The MM proportion in the resident macrophages was markedly higher than those in wild-type (WT) or caspase 1/11 KO mice. Deletion of the MMs and transplantation of the NLRP3 KO bone marrow cells showed that survival of the gut excitatory ChAT(+) and VGLUT2(+) neurons was dependent on the MMs. Gut microbiota metabolites beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) could promote gut motility through protecting MMs from pyroptosis. Thus, our data suggest that MMs regulated by NLRP3 maintain the homeostasis of excitatory neurons.",BDH1,case report; 5:2-NC; M4:3-NC,human,Human – Interventional; NS,"post-fast circulating BHB increase, up",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",post-fast,Fasting / Caloric restriction (endogenous),NS
38757723,"Twice-Weekly 36-Hour Intermittent Fasting Practice Attenuates Hunger, Quadruples ss-Hydroxybutyrate, and Maintains Weight Loss: A Case Report.","Intermittent fasting (IF) approach to weight loss obviates the inconvenience of calorie counting required in daily caloric restriction (DCR). A metabolic defense mechanism (MDM) obstructs weight loss and facilitates weight regain possibly by increasing hunger and efficiency of exercise energy expenditure (EEf), and by reducing resting metabolic rate (RMR) and energy expenditure (EE) including physical activity (PA). IF may test whether its paradigm can better counteract MDM than DCR. A knowledge gap exists about whether the duration of weekly uninterrupted fasts (UFs), when the IF protocols are isocaloric, affects the MDM. The aim and objective of this 82-week study were to determine whether 36 hours of near-absolute twice-weekly UF will exacerbate MDM but generate similar rates of weight and fat losses compared to four IF studies featuring 20 hours of weekly UF with both IF protocols matched for weekly hours of fast (108) and free access to food (60), a fasting-to-eating (F/E) ratio of 1.8. This case report presents results of twice-weekly fasting on non-consecutive days (5:2-NC) and compares them to results from a 4:3-NC protocol with a 20-hour UF caused by a modification of providing a 500-600 kcal meal on three fasting days (M4:3-NC). Because the large meal raises insulin concentration for four hours at the start of the fasting day, the 20-hour UF consists of the remaining eight hours on the fasting day, followed by 12 additional nocturnal hours of fasting. The hypotheses were that (1) because of their matched F/E ratio, the rates of weight and fat losses will be similar in both protocols, and (2) because of its longer UF period, hunger will be higher and RMR and EE will be lower, in 5:2-NC than in M4:3-NC protocol. The main findings were that the 5:2-NC protocol produced (1) slower rates of weight and fat losses, (2) modest reduction in the sensation of hunger and substantial decline in fullness, (3) no change in RMR and EE, and (4) fourfold post-fast increase in the circulating concentration of the ketone body ss-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), 2.5 greater than in the M4:3-NC protocol. The absence of increased hunger and changes in EE, the variability of the rate of weight loss in the 5:2-NC protocol, plus increased EEf in one M4:3-NC study, suggest that IF does not mitigate MDM, but that shortened UF period in M4:3-NC reduces the rise in BHB. Thus, the addition of a large meal on fasting days is unnecessary for the prevention of hunger and is counterproductive for increases in BHB and its potential health benefits. Continuous practice of the 5:2-NC protocol allows sustained weight loss and maintenance of lost weight with diminished hunger for as long as it is implemented.",0; CAMKK2,cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury,animal; in vitro,NS,"ferroptosis, down",Cell Death & Survival,kidney,Kidney,renal tubular cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Acute kidney injury,Renal & Urological,"BUN and creatinine, down; renal tubular necrosis, down","Serum creatinine, down; Kidney function, down",exogenous or endogenous beta-HB; ketogenic diet,Multi-source; Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
38763355,beta-Hydroxybutyrate Protects Against Cisplatin-Induced Renal Damage via Regulating Ferroptosis.,"Cisplatin is a particularly potent antineoplastic drug. However, its usefulness is restricted due to the induction of nephrotoxicity. More recent research has indicated that beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) protects against acute or chronic organ damage as an efficient healing agent. Nonetheless, the therapeutic mechanisms of beta-HB in acute kidney damage caused by chemotherapeutic drugs remain unclear. Our study developed a model of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), which involved the administration of a ketogenic diet or beta-HB. We analyzed blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels in serum, and used western blotting and immunohistochemical staining to assess ferroptosis and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase 2 (Camkk2)/AMPK pathway. The mitochondrial morphology and function were examined. Additionally, we conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments using selective Camkk2 inhibitor or activator to investigate the protective mechanism of beta-HB on cisplatin-induced AKI. Exogenous or endogenous beta-HB effectively alleviated cisplatin-induced abnormally elevated levels of BUN and Cr and renal tubular necrosis in vivo. Additionally, beta-HB reduced ferroptosis biomarkers and increased the levels of anti-ferroptosis biomarkers in the kidney. beta-HB also improved mitochondrial morphology and function. Moreover, beta-HB significantly attenuated cisplatin-induced cell ferroptosis and damage in vitro. Furthermore, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining indicated that beta-HB may prevent kidney injury by regulating the Camkk2-AMPK pathway. The use of the Camkk2 inhibitor or activator verified the involvement of Camkk2 in the renal protection by beta-HB. This study provided evidence of the protective effects of beta-HB against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and identified inhibited ferroptosis and Camkk2 as potential molecular mechanisms.",SNTA1; AQP4; 0,C57 mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"upregulation of SNTA1, up",Other / Unspecified,brain,Brain/CNS,microglia,Neural / Glial,Microglia,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hemorrhagic stroke,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"neurological deficits, down","Neurological deficit score, down",NS,NS,NS
38791266,beta-hydroxybutyrate alleviates neurological deficits by restoring glymphatic and inflammation after subarachnoid hemorrhage in mice.,"BACKGROUND: Both glymphatic system dysfunction and inflammatory response aggravate neurological dysfunction after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Studies have shown that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) may mitigate painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) by upregulating SNTA1 expression and reinstating AQP4 polarity. However, the potential of BHB to ameliorate glymphatic system function and inflammatory response in SAH mice remains uncertain. METHODS: The SAH models were constructed by injection of arterial blood into cisterna Magana. Three groups of C57 mice were randomly assigned: Sham, SAH, and BHB. All mice were subjected to neurological function assessment, western blot, immunofluorescence double staining, and RNA-seq. Glymphatic system function was examined with tracer and immunofluorescence double staining, and the differential genes were examined with RNA-seq. In addition, the expression of related inflammation was detected. RESULTS: Compared with the SAH group, BHB reinstated AQP4 polarization by upregulating SNTA1 protein to enhance the glymphatic system. According to RNA-seq, the different genes were primarily connected to microglia activation, astrocytes, and inflammation. Western blot and immunofluorescence further confirmed that the related inflammatory protein expression levels were upregulated. BHB attenuated neuroinflammation after SAH. Ultimately, it can mitigate the neurological deficits in SAH mice. CONCLUSION: The study reveals a novel mechanism that BHB treatment mitigates neurologic impairment in SAH mice. We propose that BHB may play a neuroprotective effect by enhancing glymphatic system function and attenuating neuroinflammatory subarachnoid hemorrhage.",FFAR3; LEP; ADIPOQ; 0,rat adrenal chromaffin (pheochromocytoma) PC12 cells,in vitro,Multi-model,"FFAR3 antagonism, down",Metabolic Regulation,adrenal chromaffin cells,Adrenal gland,PC12 cells,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
38818236,Differential Modulation of Catecholamine and Adipokine Secretion by the Short Chain Fatty Acid Receptor FFAR3 and alpha(2)-Adrenergic Receptors in PC12 Cells.,"Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) hyperactivity is mediated by elevated catecholamine (CA) secretion from the adrenal medulla, as well as enhanced norepinephrine (NE) release from peripheral sympathetic nerve terminals. Adrenal CA production from chromaffin cells is tightly regulated by sympatho-inhibitory alpha(2)-adrenergic (auto)receptors (ARs), which inhibit both epinephrine (Epi) and NE secretion via coupling to Gi/o proteins. alpha(2)-AR function is, in turn, regulated by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-kinases (GRKs), especially GRK2, which phosphorylate and desensitize them, i.e., uncouple them from G proteins. On the other hand, the short-chain free fatty acid (SCFA) receptor (FFAR)-3, also known as GPR41, promotes NE release from sympathetic neurons via the Gi/o-derived free Gbetagamma-activated phospholipase C (PLC)-beta/Ca(2+) signaling pathway. However, whether it exerts a similar effect in adrenal chromaffin cells is not known at present. In the present study, we examined the interplay of the sympatho-inhibitory alpha(2A)-AR and the sympatho-stimulatory FFAR3 in the regulation of CA secretion from rat adrenal chromaffin (pheochromocytoma) PC12 cells. We show that FFAR3 promotes CA secretion, similarly to what GRK2-dependent alpha(2A)-AR desensitization does. In addition, FFAR3 activation enhances the effect of the physiologic stimulus (acetylcholine) on CA secretion. Importantly, GRK2 blockade to restore alpha(2A)-AR function or the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB or 3-hydroxybutyrate), via FFAR3 antagonism, partially suppress CA production, when applied individually. When combined, however, CA secretion from PC12 cells is profoundly suppressed. Finally, propionate-activated FFAR3 induces leptin and adiponectin secretion from PC12 cells, two important adipokines known to be involved in tissue inflammation, and this effect of FFAR3 is fully blocked by the ketone BHB. In conclusion, SCFAs can promote CA and adipokine secretion from adrenal chromaffin cells via FFAR3 activation, but the metabolite/ketone body BHB can effectively inhibit this action.",0,mouse; acute insulin resistance (AIR),animal,Animal – Mouse; NS,"neuronal function, up",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,brain,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Insulin resistance,Metabolic & Endocrine,"axonal conduction, up; synchronization, up; long-term potentiation (LTP), up","Axonal conduction, up; Synchronization, up; Learning, up",exogenous KB D-ꞵ-hydroxybutyrate (D-ꞵHb),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

Neuronal KB uptake, which does not rely on glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) or insulin, has shown promising clinical applicability in alleviating the neurological and cognitive effects of disorders with hypometabolic components. However, the specific mechanisms by which such interventions affect neuronal functions are poorly understood. In this study, we pharmacologically blocked GLUT4 to investigate the effects of exogenous KB D-ꞵ-hydroxybutyrate (D-ꞵHb) on mouse brain metabolism during acute insulin resistance (AIR). We found that both AIR and D-ꞵHb had distinct impacts across neuronal compartments: AIR decreased synaptic activity and long-term potentiation (LTP) and impaired axonal conduction, synchronization, and action potential properties, while D-ꞵHb rescued neuronal functions associated with axonal conduction, synchronization, and LTP.",0,patients with alopecia areata; healthy controls; outer root sheath (ORS) cells,human; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; In vitro – Primary cells,"inflammatory cytokine production, up",Inflammation & Immune Response,hair follicles,Skin/Integument,outer root sheath (ORS) cells,Epithelial – Skin & Eye,Keratinocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alopecia areata,Dermatologic,"hair loss severity, up; treatment resistance, up","Hair loss severity, up; Treatment resistance, up",produced during SGLT2 inhibition,NS,NS
38891898,Possible role of beta-hydroxybutyrate in inducing inflammation in alopecia areata.,"Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by non-scarring hair loss due to an immune response that targets hair follicles. The current treatment approach for AA involves the use of immunosuppressants and immunomodulators to reduce cytokine levels around affected hair follicles. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as potential anti-inflammatory agents with diverse beneficial effects in various medical conditions. This study investigates the role of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body produced during SGLT2 inhibition, in the pathogenesis of AA. Serum BHB levels were found to be significantly elevated in patients with AA compared with healthy controls, with higher levels correlating with severity of hair loss. BHB treatment increased inflammatory cytokine production in outer root sheath (ORS) cells, mimicking the inflammatory conditions seen in AA. The results suggest that elevated BHB levels may exacerbate the inflammatory immune response in AA patients and may be associated with chronic hair loss and resistance to treatment. Serum BHB levels may serve as a potential marker of poor prognosis in patients with severe AA. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise role of BHB in the pathogenesis of AA and its implications for disease management.",GFAP; IL1B; TNF; OGG1,mice; photothrombotic stroke,animal,Animal – Mouse,"Nrf2/ARE pathway activation, up",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,brain,Brain/CNS,astrocyte,Neural / Glial,Astrocytes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Stroke,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"sensorimotor function improved, nan; cognitive function improved, nan","Motor function, nan; Cognition, nan",betaHB with drinking water,Drinking water / Diet admixture,NS
38895313,Beta-Hydroxybutyrate Mitigates Sensorimotor and Cognitive Impairments in a Photothrombosis-Induced Ischemic Stroke in Mice.,"The consequences of stroke include cognitive deficits and sensorimotor disturbances, which are largely related to mitochondrial impairments in the brain. In this work, we have shown that the mimetic of the ketogenic diet beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) can improve neurological brain function in stroke. At 3 weeks after photothrombotic stroke, mice receiving betaHB with drinking water before and after surgery recovered faster in terms of sensorimotor functions assessed by the string test and static rods and cognitive functions assessed by the Morris water maze. At the same time, the betaHB-treated mice had lower expression of some markers of astrocyte activation and inflammation (Gfap, Il-1b, Tnf). We hypothesize that long-term administration of betaHB promotes the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) pathway, which leads to increased expression of antioxidant genes targeting mitochondria and genes involved in signaling pathways necessary for the maintenance of synaptic plasticity. betaHB partially maintained mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity during the first days after photothrombosis. However, in the following three weeks, the number of mtDNA damages increased in all experimental groups, which coincided with a decrease in Ogg1 expression, which plays an important role in mtDNA repair. Thus, we can assume that betaHB is not only an important metabolite that provides additional energy to brain tissue during recovery from stroke under conditions of mitochondrial damage but also an important signaling molecule that supports neuronal plasticity and reduces neuroinflammation.",0,NS,NS,NS,"Ca(2+)-dependent upregulation of mitochondrial metabolism, up",Multiple mechanisms,brain,Brain/CNS,excitatory nerve terminals; inhibitory nerve terminals,Neural / Glial,Neurons,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS

Although ketones are able to fuel the brain, it is not known whether ketones are directly metabolized by neurons on a time scale sufficiently rapid to fuel the bioenergetic demands of sustained synaptic transmission. Here, we show that nerve terminals can use the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate in a cell- autonomous fashion to support neurotransmission in both excitatory and inhibitory nerve terminals and that this flexibility relies on Ca(2+) dependent upregulation of mitochondrial metabolism. Using a genetically encoded ATP sensor, we show that inhibitory axons fueled by ketones sustain much higher ATP levels under steady state conditions than excitatory axons, but that the kinetics of ATP production following activity are slower when using ketones as fuel compared to lactate/pyruvate for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.",GCG; 0,18 adults with prediabetes,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"oxyntomodulin involvement in lowering plasma glucose, down",Hormonal Regulation,plasma,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"plasma glucose, down","Blood glucose, down",ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (KEbetaHB)-supplemented beverage,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Proglucagon-derived peptides (PGDP) have been shown to have a glucose-regulating effect. However, whether they play a role in diabetes remission remains poorly understood. AIM: To investigate changes in plasma levels of PGDP in glycaemic responders versus non-responders. METHODS: The study was a randomised placebo-controlled trial comprising 18 adults with prediabetes (registered at www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov as NCT03889210). Following an overnight fast, participants consumed ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (KEbetaHB)-supplemented beverage and placebo beverage in crossover manner. Serial blood samples were collected from baseline to 150 min at 30-min intervals. The endpoints were changes in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glicentin, oxyntomodulin, glucagon, and major proglucagon fragment (MPGF). Participants were stratified into the 'responders' and 'non-responders' subgroups based on their glycaemic changes following the ingestion of KEbetaHB. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to estimate the accumulated changes in the studied PGDP and compared using paired-t test between the KEbetaHB and placebo beverages. RESULTS: Responders had a significantly greater reduction in plasma glucose compared with non-responders following acute ketosis (p < 0.001). The AUC(0-150) for oxyntomodulin was significantly lower following the KEbetaHB beverage compared with the placebo (p = 0.045) in responders, but not in non-responders (p = 0.512).

The aim was to investigate the effect of a ketone ester beverage delivering beta-hydroxybutyrate (KEbetaHB) on plasma levels of GDF-15, as well as assess the influence of eating behaviour on it. The study was a randomised controlled trial (registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03889210). Individuals were given a KEbetaHB beverage or placebo in a cross-over fashion. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min after ingestion. Eating behaviour was assessed using the three-factor eating questionnaire. GDF-15 levels were not significantly different (p = 0.503) after the KEbetaHB beverage compared with the placebo.

38936830,Intestinal Ketogenesis and Permeability.,"Consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) has been suggested as a contributing factor behind increased intestinal permeability in obesity, leading to increased plasma levels of microbial endotoxins and, thereby, increased systemic inflammation. We and others have shown that HFD can induce jejunal expression of the ketogenic rate-limiting enzyme mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS). HMGCS is activated via the free fatty acid binding nuclear receptor PPAR-alpha, and it is a key enzyme in ketone body synthesis that was earlier believed to be expressed exclusively in the liver. The function of intestinal ketogenesis is unknown but has been described in suckling rats and mice pups, possibly in order to allow large molecules, such as immunoglobulins, to pass over the intestinal barrier. Therefore, we hypothesized that ketone bodies could regulate intestinal barrier function, e.g., via regulation of tight junction proteins. The primary aim was to compare the effects of HFD that can induce intestinal ketogenesis to an equicaloric carbohydrate diet on inflammatory responses, nutrition sensing, and intestinal permeability in human jejunal mucosa. Fifteen healthy volunteers receiving a 2-week HFD diet compared to a high-carbohydrate diet were compared. Blood samples and mixed meal tests were performed at the end of each dietary period to examine inflammation markers and postprandial endotoxemia. Jejunal biopsies were assessed for protein expression using Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and morphometric characteristics of tight junctions by electron microscopy. Functional analyses of permeability and ketogenesis were performed in Caco-2 cells, mice, and human enteroids. Ussing chambers were used to analyze permeability. CRP and ALP values were within normal ranges and postprandial endotoxemia levels were low and did not differ between the two diets. The PPARalpha receptor was ketone body-dependently reduced after HFD. None of the tight junction proteins studied, nor the basal electrical parameters, were different between the two diets. However, the ketone body inhibitor hymeglusin increased resistance in mucosal biopsies. In addition, the tight junction protein claudin-3 was increased by ketone inhibition in human enteroids. The ketone body beta-Hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) did not, however, change the mucosal transition of the large-size molecular FD4-probe or LPS in Caco-2 and mouse experiments. We found that PPARalpha expression was inhibited by the ketone body betaHB. As PPARalpha regulates HMGCS expression, the ketone bodies thus exert negative feedback signaling on their own production. Furthermore, ketone bodies were involved in the regulation of permeability on intestinal mucosal cells in vitro and ex vivo. We were not, however, able to reproduce these effects on intestinal permeability in vivo in humans when comparing two weeks of high-fat with high-carbohydrate diet in healthy volunteers. Further, neither the expression of inflammation markers nor the aggregate tight junction proteins were changed. Thus, it seems that not only HFD but also other factors are needed to permit increased intestinal permeability in vivo. This indicates that the healthy gut can adapt to extremes of macro-nutrients and increased levels of intestinally produced ketone bodies, at least during a shorter dietary challenge.",0,mice; Japanese adults,animal; human,Animal – Mouse; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"safety, positive","Safety, positive",Halomonas sp.

Low carbohydrate intake (< 25 g) allows the body to utilize fat as its primary fuel. As a consequence of increased fatty acid oxidation, the liver produces ketones to serve as an alternative energy source. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) is the most abundant ketone. While betaHB has a wide range of functions outside of the pancreas, its direct effects on islet cell function remain understudied. We examined human islet secretory response to acute racemic betaHB treatment and observed increased insulin secretion at a low glucose concentration of 3 mM. Because betaHB is a chiral molecule, existing as both R and S forms, we further studied insulin and glucagon secretion following acute treatment with individual betaHB enantiomers in human and C57BL/6J mouse islets. We found that acute treatment with R-betaHB increased insulin secretion and decreased glucagon secretion at physiological glucose concentrations in both human and mouse islets. Proteomic analysis of human islets treated with R-betaHB over 72 hours showed altered abundance of proteins that may promote islet cell health and survival.

The benefit of this treatment is best documented in multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) (MIM#231680). One might also expect ketone bodies to help in other disorders with impaired ketogenesis or in conditions that profit from a ketogenic diet. Here, we report the use of a novel preparation of dextro-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-betaHB) salts in two cases of MADD and one case of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) deficiency (MIM#312170). The two patients with MADD had previously been on a racemic mixture of D- and L‑sodium hydroxybutyrate. Patient #1 found D-betaHB more palatable, and the change in formulation corrected hypernatraemia in patient #2. The patient with PDH deficiency was on a ketogenic diet but had not previously been given hydroxybutyrate. In this case, the addition of D-betaHB improved ketosis. We conclude that NHS101 is a good candidate for further clinical studies in this group of diseases of inborn errors of metabolism.",ATF6; EIF2AK3; DDIT3; BECN1; MAP1LC3B; SQSTM1; ATG5; NLRP3; TXNIP; IL1B; NFKB1,SH-SY5Y (A beta1-42 and LPS-induced),in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"maladaptive UPR, down",General Stress Responses,neurons,NS,SH-SY5Y cells,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"cell viability, up","Cell viability, up",BHB,NS,NS

A maladaptive unfolded protein response (UPR), excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis aggravate the disease. Melatonin (MEL) and hydroxybutyrate (BHB) have both shown promise in terms of decreasing Abeta pathology. The goal of this study was to see how BHB and MEL affected the UPR, autophagy, and pyroptosis pathways in Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with BHB, MEL, or a combination of the two after being exposed to A beta1-42 and LPS. Cell viability was determined using the MTT test, and gene expression levels of UPR (ATF6, PERK, and CHOP), autophagy (Beclin-1, LC3II, P62, and Atg5), and pyroptosis-related markers (NLRP3, TXNIP, IL-1beta, and NFkappaB1) were determined using quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). For statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA was employed, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: BHB and MEL significantly increased SH-SY5Y cell viability in the presence of A beta1-42 and LPS. Both compounds inhibited the expression of maladaptive UPR and autophagy-related genes, as well as inflammatory and pyroptotic markers caused by Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSION: BHB and MEL rescue neurons in A beta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells by reducing maladaptive UPR, excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis.

Using mass spectrometry-based stable isotope tracing and shotgun lipidomics, we established a novel link between ketogenesis and MASLD pathophysiology. Our findings show that mouse liver and primary hepatocytes consume ketone bodies to support fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis via both de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and FA elongation. Analysis of (13) C-labeled FAs in hepatocytes lacking mitochondrial D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1) revealed a partial reliance on mitochondrial conversion of D-betaOHB to acetoacetate (AcAc) for cytoplasmic DNL contribution, whereas FA elongation from ketone bodies was fully dependent on cytosolic acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS). Ketone bodies were essential for polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) homeostasis in hepatocytes, as loss of AACS diminished both free and esterified PUFAs. Ketogenic insufficiency depleted liver PUFAs and increased triacylglycerols, mimicking human MASLD, suggesting that ketogenesis supports PUFA homeostasis, and may mitigate MASLD-MASH progression in humans.",TNF; IL1B,HMC3 human microglia-like cells,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"redox status, up",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,brain,Brain/CNS,HMC3 microglia-like cells,Neural / Glial,Microglia,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Neurodegenerative,"phagocytic activity, up","Phagocytic activity, up",BHB supplementation,NS,NS

Microglia, the neuroimmune cells must function effectively to offer immune defence and debris removal in low-energy settings. Brain glucose deprivation may compromise microglial functions further escalating the disease pathology and deteriorating the overall mental health. In the current study, HMC3 human microglia-like cells were cultured in vitro and exposed to glucose deprivation to investigate the effects of glucose deprivation on phenotypic state, redox status, secretion of cytokines and phagocytic capabilities of HMC3 cells. However, HMC3 cells were able to proliferate in the absence of glucose but showed signs of redox imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction, as demonstrated by decreased MTT reduction and Mito Tracker staining of cells, along with a concomitant reduction in NOX2 protein, superoxide, and nitrite levels. Reduced levels of secreted TNF and IL-1beta were the signs of compromised cytokine secretion by glucose-deprived HMC3 microglia-like cells. Moreover, glucose-deprived HMC3 cells also showed reduced phagocytic activity as assessed by fluorescently labelled latex beads-based functional phagocytosis assay. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supplementation restored the redox status, mitochondrial health, cytokine secretion, and phagocytic activity of glucose-deprived HMC3 microglia-like cells. Overall, impaired brain glucose metabolism may hinder microglia's capacity to release diffusible immune factors and perform phagocytosis. This could escalate the mental health issues in neurological diseases where brain glucose metabolism is compromised.

Since this dietary approach stimulates the liver's production of ketone bodies, primarily beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which serves as an alternative energy source for neurons, we investigated whether BHB could mitigate impaired AMPA receptor trafficking, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline induced by metabolic challenges such as saturated fatty acids. Here, we observe that, in cultured primary cortical neurons, exposure to palmitic acid (200muM) decreased surface levels of glutamate GluA1-containing AMPA receptors, whereas unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (200muM), and BHB (5mM) increased them. Furthermore, BHB countered the adverse effects of palmitic acid on synaptic GluA1 levels in hippocampal neurons, as well as excitability and plasticity in hippocampal slices. Additionally, daily intragastric administration of BHB (100 mg/kg/day) for two months reversed cognitive impairment induced by a saturated high-fat diet (49% of calories from fat) in a mouse experimental model of obesity. In summary, our findings underscore the significant impact of fatty acids and ketone bodies on AMPA receptors abundance, synaptic function and neuroplasticity, shedding light on the potential use of BHB to delay cognitive impairments associated with metabolic diseases.",HDAC1; HDAC2,mucosal biopsies from UC patients; colons of DSS-induced colitis mice; in vitro,human; animal; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Animal – Mouse; NS,"histone acetylation at H3K9ac, up",Epigenetic Regulation,colon,Large intestine/Colon,goblet cells,Epithelial – Gastrointestinal,Goblet cells,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Ulcerative colitis,Autoimmune & Inflammatory,"colitis severity, decreased","Colitis severity, decreased",ketogenesis,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

This study aims to confirm the induction and mechanisms of ADORA3 activation on goblet cells in ulcerative colitis (UC). A significant decrease in ADORA3 expression was found in mucosal biopsies from UC patients and in the colons of colitis mice. This reduction correlated negatively with disease severity and positively with goblet cell number. ADORA3 activation mitigated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and facilitated ATOH1-mediated goblet cell differentiation in both in vivo and in vitro. Metabolomics analysis unveiled that ADORA3 activation bolstered ketogenesis, leading to elevated levels of the metabolite BHB. Subsequently, BHB heightened the activity of HDAC1/2, augmenting histone acetylation at the H3K9ac site within the promoter region of the ATOH1 gene. Furthermore, the reason for ADORA3 activation to enhance ketogenesis was attributed to controlling the competitive binding among beta-arrestin2, SHP1 and PPARgamma. This results in the non-ligand-dependent activation of PPARgamma, thereby promoting the transcription of HMGCS2. The exact mechanisms by which ADORA3 promoted goblet cell differentiation and alleviated UC were elucidated using MRS1191 and shHMGCS2 plasmid. Collectively, ADORA3 activation promoted goblet cell differentiation and alleviated UC by enhancing ketogenesis via the ""BHB-HDAC1/2-H3K9ac"" pathway.",BDH1; 0,healthy donor T cells,in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"BDH1-mediated BHB utilization, up",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,T cells,Hematopoietic / Immune,T cells,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"T cell function, up","Immune function, up",2mM BHB,In vitro media supplementation,NS

However, their potential effects on the immune system need investigation. This study aims to explore how glucose concentration and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) impact T cell phenotype, metabolism, and function, with a focus on systemic inflammatory response (T2D) and autoimmunity (T1D). METHODS: T cells from healthy donors were cultured in vitro under varying glucose concentrations with or without BHB. Flow cytometry was employed to analyze changes in T cell phenotype, while proliferation was evaluated through a CFSE dilution assay. Additionally, we used a novel flow cytometry method allowing a direct assessment of T cell metabolism. RESULTS: Culturing T cells in low glucose concentrations revealed their dependency on glucose metabolism, leading to reduced proliferation rates, overexpression of exhaustion markers and increased susceptibility to Treg suppression and the influence of immune-modulating drugs such as rapamycin, FK506, and MMF. Notably, T cells cultured in low glucose concentrations increased the expression of BDH1 to utilize BHB as an alternative fuel source. Finally, the addition of BHB to the culture effectively rescued T cell impairments caused by insufficient glucose levels. CONCLUSIONS: T cells display limited capacity to adapt to low glucose levels, resulting in profound functional impairment. However, T cell functions can be efficiently recovered by the presence of 2mM BHB.",UCP1; PRDM16; PPARGC1A; CIDEA; CIDEC; MTNR1A,male Sprague-Dawley rats; HFD-fed rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"thermogenic gene expression, up",Metabolic Regulation,brown adipose tissue,Adipose tissue,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Obesity,Metabolic & Endocrine,"BAT whitening, down; weight gain, down; lipid profile, improved","BAT whitening, down; Body weight, down; Lipid profile, improved",a BHB solution in their drinking water,Drinking water / Diet admixture,NS

METHODS: We employed a 7-week experimental design for a study on 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats divided into five groups: (1) a control-diet fed group; (2) a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed group; (3) a group that received an HFD and a BHB solution in their drinking water; (4) a group that received an HFD with 10 mg/kg/day melatonin in their drinking water; and (5) a group that received an HFD and were also treated with the combination of BHB and melatonin. Following the treatment period, biochemical indices, gene expression levels of key thermogenic markers (including uncoupling protein 1 [UCP1], PR domain containing 16 [PRDM16], Cidea, fat-specific protein 27 [Fsp27], and metallothionein 1 [MT1]), and stereological assessments of BAT were evaluated. RESULTS: Treatment with BHB and melatonin significantly boosted blood ketone levels, improved lipid profiles, and reduced weight gain from an HFD. It also downregulated genes linked to WAT, namely, Cidea and Fsp27, and upregulated key BAT markers, including UCP1, PRDM16 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1-alpha. Additionally, the co-treatment increased MT1 receptor expression and enhanced the structural density of BAT. CONCLUSION: The combined oral administration of BHB and melatonin successfully prevented the whitening of BAT in obese rats fed an HFD, indicating its potential as a therapeutic strategy for obesity-related BAT dysfunction. The synergistic effects of this treatment underscore the potential of a combined approach to address BAT dysfunction in obesity.",HCAR2; 0; PINK1,OA rats; chondrocytes (TBHP-induced),animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Primary cells,"mitophagy, up",Cell Death & Survival,cartilage,Cartilage,chondrocyte,Bone & Cartilage,Chondrocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Osteoarthritis,Musculoskeletal & Connective Tissue,"cartilage pathological damage, down","Cartilage damage, down",ketogenic diet (KD); betaOHB,Ketogenic diet (endogenous); NS,NS

The ketogenic diet (KD) has been postulated to impede the advancement of various inflammatory ailments. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), a prominent constituent of ketone bodies, has recently been proposed to possess crucial signaling capabilities. In this study, we propose to explore the role and mechanism of betaOHB in OA. Tissue staining and inflammatory factor assay were employed to evaluate the impacts of KD and betaOHB on OA rats. The oxidative stress conditions in chondrocytes were induced using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). The mechanisms were determined using the siRNA of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2), the antagonist of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the inhibitor of mitophagy. The administration of KD demonstrated a reduction in pathological damage to cartilage, as well as a decrease in plasma levels of inflammatory factors. Furthermore, it resulted in an increase in the concentration of betaOHB in the blood and synovial fluid. In vitro experiments showed that betaOHB facilitated mitophagy and adenosine triphosphate production. Besides, betaOHB mitigated chondrocyte senescence, inflammatory factors secretion, extracellular matrix degradation, and apoptosis induced by TBHP. Subsequent investigations indicated that the protective effects of betaOHB were no longer observed following the knockdown of HCAR2, the antagonist of AMPK, or the inhibitor of mitophagy. Moreover, in vivo studies suggested that betaOHB played a protective role by targeting the HCAR2-AMPK-PINK1 axis. In conclusion, betaOHB enhanced chondrocyte mitophagy through the HCAR2/AMPK/PINK1/Parkin pathway, offering a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of OA.",EPO,12 males,human,NS,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",ketone monoester plus glucose (KE + CHO),Ketone ester (KE),NS

39190570,beta-Hydroxybutyrate enhances astrocyte glutamate uptake through EAAT1 expression regulation.,"beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) has been reported to exert neuroprotective functions and is considered a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Numerous studies have revealed BHB's multifaceted roles, including anti-senescence, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the underlying mechanisms warrant further investigation. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system, play a pivotal role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. While BHB is known to alter neuronal metabolism and function, its effects on astrocytes remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted transcriptome sequencing analysis to identify differentially expressed genes induced by BHB in astrocytes and found that the gene Solute carrier family 1 member 3 (Slc1a3), encoding the glutamate transporter EAAT1, was significantly upregulated by BHB treatment. Cellular and animal-based experiments confirmed an increase in EAAT1 protein expression in primary astrocytes and the hippocampus of mice treated with BHB. This upregulation may be due to the activation of the Ca(2+)/CAMKII pathway by BHB. Furthermore, BHB improved astrocytes' glutamate uptake and partially restored neuronal viability impaired by glutamate-induced excitotoxicity when astrocytes were functionalized. Our results suggest that BHB may alleviate neuronal damage caused by excessive glutamate by enhancing the glutamate absorption and uptake capacity of astrocytes. This study proposes a novel mechanism for the neuroprotective effects of BHB and reinforces its beneficial impact on the central nervous system (CNS).",0,16 males,human,NS,"oxygen saturation decline, down",Other / Unspecified,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"blood oxygen saturation, up","Oxygen delivery, up",(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (R-BD R-betaHB) ketone monoester (KME),Ketone ester (KE),NS

In a single-blind randomized crossover design, 16 males performed assessments of cognitive performance before and during hypoxic exposure with moderate exercise [2 x 20 min weighted ruck ( approximately 22 kg) at 3.2 km/h at 10% incline] in a normobaric altitude chamber (4572 m, 11.8% O(2)). The R-BD R-betaHB KME (573 mg/kg) or a calorie- and taste-matched placebo ( approximately 50 g maltodextrin) were co-ingested with 40 g of dextrose before exposure to hypoxia.

In this study, we present a molecular hybrid between (S)-lactate and the BHB-precursor (R)-1,3-butanediol in the form of a simple ester referred to as LaKe. We show that LaKe can be readily prepared on the kilogram scale and undergoes rapid hydrolytic conversion under a variety of physiological conditions to release its two constituents.

The ketogenic diet significantly affects cell energy metabolism and functioning of mitochondria, which has been actively studied in various age-related pathologies. Here, we investigated the effect of the ketogenic diet mimetic beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on the expression of genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis (Ppargc1a, Nrf1, Tfam), quality control (Sqstm1), functioning of the antioxidant system (Nfe2l2, Gpx1, Gpx3, Srxn1, Txnrd2, Slc6a9, Slc7a11), and inflammatory response (Il1b, Tnf, Ptgs2, Gfap) in the brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and muscles of young and old rats. We also analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, accumulation of mtDNA damage, and levels of oxidative stress based on the concentration of reduced glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). In some organs, aging disrupted mitochondrial biogenesis and functioning of cell antioxidant system, which was accompanied by the increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Administration of BHB for 2 weeks had different effects on the organs of young and old rats. In particular, BHB upregulated expression of genes coding for proteins associated with the mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant system, especially in the liver and muscles of young (but not old) rats. At the same time, BHB contributed to the reduction of TBARS in the kidneys of old rats. Therefore, our study has shown that administration of ketone bodies significantly affected gene expression in organs, especially in young rats, by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, improving the functioning of the antioxidant defense system, and partially reducing the level of oxidative stress.

We specifically examined the levels and cellular localization of pyroptosis within the lung, which revealed alveolar macrophages as the primary site. The inhibition of pyroptosis by VX-765 reduced the severity of lung injury, underscoring its significant role in LIRI. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) in ameliorating LIRI was examined.

This revealed that beta-OHB exerts lung-protective and anti-pyroptotic effects, which were mediated through the upregulation of SIRT1 and the enhancement of FOXO3 deacetylation, leading to decreased pyroptosis markers and lung injury. In addition, beta-OHB treatment of MH-S cells in vitro showed a concentration-dependent improvement in pyroptosis, linking its therapeutic benefits to specific cell mechanisms. Overall, this study highlights the significance of alveolar macrophage pyroptosis in the exacerbation of LIRI and indicates the potential of beta-OHB in mitigating injury by modulating the SIRT1-FOXO3 signaling pathway.",HCAR2; CD86; IL1B; NOS2,intestinal surgical resections from IBD patients; U937-derived macrophages; M1 macrophages; intestinal fibroblasts,human; in vitro,Human – Observational/Patient samples; In vitro – Immortalized cell line; In vitro – Primary cells,"GPR109A gene expression, up",Other / Unspecified,intestinal surgical resections,Gastrointestinal (unspecified segment),U937-derived macrophages,Hematopoietic / Immune,Monocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",beta-hydroxybutyrate,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
39267855,A disturbed metabolite-GPCR axis is associated with microbial dysbiosis in IBD patients: Potential role of GPR109A in macrophages.,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by disrupted immune function. Indeed, gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolomic profile alterations, are hallmarks of IBD. In this scenario, metabolite-sensing G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), involved in several biological processes, have emerged as pivotal players in the pathophysiology of IBD. The aim of this study was to characterize the axis microbiota-metabolite-GPCR in intestinal surgical resections from IBD patients. Results showed that UC patients had a lower microbiota richness and bacterial load, with a higher proportion of the genus Cellulosimicrobium and a reduced proportion of Escherichia, whereas CD patients showed a decreased abundance of Enterococcus. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis revealed alterations in carboxylic acids, fatty acids, and amino acids in UC and CD samples. These patients also exhibited upregulated expression of most metabolite-sensing GPCRs analysed, which positively correlated with pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers. The role of GPR109A was studied in depth and increased expression of this receptor was detected in epithelial cells and cells from lamina propria, including CD68+ macrophages, in IBD patients. The treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate increased gene expression of GPR109A, CD86, IL1B and NOS2 in U937-derived macrophages. Besides, when GPR109A was transiently silenced, the mRNA expression and secretion of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were impaired in M1 macrophages. Finally, the secretome from siGPR109A M1 macrophages reduced the gene and protein expression of COL1A1 and COL3A1 in intestinal fibroblasts. A better understanding of metabolite-sensing GPCRs, such as GPR109A, could establish their potential as therapeutic targets for managing IBD.",UCP1; PRDM16; FGF21; FNDC5; 0; SIRT1; PPARGC1A,3T3-L1 cells; Male Sprague Dawley rats,animal; in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line; Animal – Rat,"AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1alpha pathway, up",Multiple mechanisms,WAT,Adipose tissue,3T3-L1 adipocytes,Adipose,Preadipocytes,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,nan,Other / Unspecified,"body weight, down; blood lipids, down; WAT browning (thermogenesis), up","Body weight, down; Lipid profile, down; Thermogenesis, up",sodium beta-HB; ketogenic diet (KD); exercise (EX),Ketone salt (KS); Ketogenic diet (endogenous); NS,NS
39282341,Ketogenic diet with aerobic exercise can induce fat browning: potential roles of beta-hydroxybutyrate.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite evidence suggesting that metabolic intermediates like beta-HB influence white adipose tissue (WAT) metabolism, the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) on the fat browning program and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms using both in vitro and in vivo models. We assessed the effects of beta-HB on fat browning in adipocytes using 3T3-L1 cells and rat models. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of beta-HB on fat browning, thermogenesis, lipid accumulation, adipokine expression, and mitochondrial biogenesis by treating mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes with sodium beta-HB for 24 h or by continuously exposing preadipocytes to beta-HB during the 8-day differentiation process. Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into control, exercise only (EX), ketogenic diet only (KD), and combined exercise and ketogenic diet (KE) groups for an 8-week intervention involving diet and/or exercise. After intervention, we evaluated WAT histology, plasma lipids and adipokines, and the expression of markers related to fat browning, thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in WAT of rats. RESULTS: In our adipocyte culture experiments, beta-HB reduced intracellular lipid accumulation by enhancing lipolysis and stimulated the expression of thermogenic and fat browning genes like uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), and adipokines such as fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FDNC5). Additionally, beta-HB activated the AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1alpha pathway, with UCP1 and PRDM16 upregulation mediated by beta-HB intracellular action and SIRT1 activity. In animal experiments, KE group raised beta-HB levels, decreasing body weight and blood lipids. KD with EX promoted WAT browning possibly via AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1alpha, augmenting PRDM16, UCP1, FGF21, and FNDC5 expression. CONCLUSION: beta-HB induction via KD and/or EX shows potential in promoting WAT browning by activating mitochondrial biogenesis, lipolysis, and thermogenesis, suggesting that dietary and physical intervention inducing beta-HB may benefit metabolic health.",0,TAC-MI mice; csMPC2-/- mice; csBDH1-/- mice; DKO (csMPC2-/- x csBDH1-/-) mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"cardiac ketone metabolism, down",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Heart failure,Cardiovascular,"heart failure, improved","Cardiac function, improved",ketogenic diet (KD); U-(13)C-beta-hydroxybutyrate,Ketogenic diet (endogenous); Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
39288030,Ketone Body Metabolism is Not Required for Improvement of Heart Failure by Ketogenic Diet in Mice.,"Failing hearts increasingly metabolize ketone bodies, and enhancing ketosis improves heart failure (HF) remodeling. Circulating ketones are elevated by fasting/starvation, which is mimicked with a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ""ketogenic diet"" (KD). While speculated that KD improves HF through increased ketone oxidation, some evidence suggests KD paradoxically downregulates cardiac ketone oxidation despite increased ketone delivery. We sought to clarify the significance of cardiac ketone metabolism during KD in HF. Mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction with apical myocardial infarction (TAC-MI) and fed either low-fat (LF) control or KD. Cardiac-specific mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 2 (csMPC2-/-) mice were used as a second model of heart failure. In both mice, feeding a KD improved HF, determined by echocardiography, heart weights, and gene expression analyses. Although KD increases plasma ketone bodies, gene expression for ketone metabolic genes is decreased in the hearts of KD-fed mice. Cardiac-specific beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (csBDH1-/-), the first enzyme in ketone catabolism, mice were also studied and crossed with the csMPC2-/- mice to create double knockout (DKO) mice. These mice were aged to 16 weeks and switched to LF or KD, and KD was able to completely normalize the hearts of both csMPC2-/- and DKO mice, suggesting that ketone metabolism is unnecessary for improving heart failure with ketogenic diet. These studies were then repeated, and mice injected with U-(13)C-beta-hydroxybutyrate to evaluate ketone metabolism. KD feeding significantly decreased the enrichment of the TCA cycle from ketone body carbons, as did the BDH1-deletion in DKO mice. Gene expression and respirometry suggests that KD instead increases cardiac fat oxidation. In conclusion, these results suggest that ketogenic diet decreases cardiac ketone metabolism and does not require ketone metabolism to improve heart failure.",0,Sprague-Dawley rat; neonatal offspring,animal,Animal – Rat; NS,"mitochondrial function and oxidative stress/inflammation, NS",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Cardiac dysfunction,Cardiovascular,"oxygen delivery, attenuated impairment","Oxygen delivery, attenuated impairment",daily subcutaneous injection of ketone solution (containing beta-hydroxybutyrate [betaOHB]),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Ketone supplementation has been shown to confer cardioprotective effects in numerous disease models. Here, we tested the hypothesis that maternal ketone supplementation during gestation would mitigate cardiac dysfunction in ID neonates. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an iron-restricted or iron-replete diet before and throughout pregnancy. Throughout gestation, iron-restricted dams were given either a daily subcutaneous injection of ketone solution (containing beta-hydroxybutyrate [betaOHB]) or saline (vehicle). Neonatal offspring cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography at postnatal days (PD)3 and 13. Hearts and livers were collected post-mortem for assessments of mitochondrial function and gene expression profiles of markers oxidative stress and inflammation. Maternal iron restriction caused neonatal anemia and asymmetric growth restriction at all time points assessed, and maternal betaOHB treatment had no effect on these outcomes. Echocardiography revealed reduced ejection fraction despite enlarged hearts (relative to body weight) in ID offspring, resulting in impaired oxygen delivery, which was attenuated by maternal betaOHB supplementation. Further, maternal ketone supplementation affected biochemical markers of mitochondrial function, oxidative stress and inflammation in hearts of neonates, implicating these pathways in the protective effects conferred by betaOHB. In summary, betaOHB supplementation confers protection against cardiac dysfunction in ID neonates and could have implications for the treatment of anemic babies.",0,34 students and cadre at the US Army 10th Special Forces Group Special Operations Advanced Mountaineering School (SOAMS),human,Multi-model,"blood ketone levels, up",Metabolic Regulation,blood,Blood,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cognitive performance, no-change; physical performance, no-change","Cognitive performance, no-change; Exercise capacity, no-change",exogenous ketone monoester (KME),Ketone ester (KE),NS

Given the promising empirical demonstration of the efficacy of exogenous ketone monoester (KME) supplementation in attenuating cognitive performance decrease during hypoxia at rest in a laboratory setting, we conducted a real-world, field experiment examining KME's efficacy during high-altitude mountaineering, an austere environment in which US SOF have conducted increasing numbers of operations over the past two decades. METHODS: Specifically, 34 students and cadre at the US Army 10th Special Forces Group Special Operations Advanced Mountaineering School (SOAMS) participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PLA)-controlled crossover trial (KME vs. PLA) over 2 days of tactical mountain operations training. The participants ascended from 7,500 ft in altitude (basecamp) to 12,460 ft on 1 day and 13,627 ft the other day (in randomized order), while performing various training activities inducing high physical and cognitive loads over 8-12 h, and consumed six doses of KME or PLA 2-3 h apart throughout each training day. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: While KME increased blood ketone levels and decreased glucose levels, there were no clear indications that the elevated ketone level enhanced physical or cognitive performance. KME also produced a greater incidence of heartburn, nausea, and vomiting. In these elite operators, high-altitude mountaineering had a limited impact on cognitive performance, and KME supplementation did not demonstrate any benefit.",0,GWAS (ketone bodies); GWAS (aortic dissection),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,aorta,Vasculature,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Aortic dissection,Cardiovascular,"risk of aortic dissection, down","Aortic dissection risk, down",genetically predicted 3-hydroxybutyrate,NS,NS
39304944,The potential protective effect of 3-Hydroxybutyrate against aortic dissection: a mendelian randomization analysis.,"BACKGROUND: 3-Hydroxybutyrate, also called beta-hydroxybutyrate, is a significant constituent of ketone bodies. Previous observational and experimental studies have suggested that ketogenic diet, especially 3-hydroxybutyrate, may have a protective effect against cardiovascular disease. However, the relationship between ketone bodies, especially 3-hydroxybutyrate, and aortic dissection remains uncertain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Publicly accessible data from genome-wide association study (GWAS) was utilized to obtain information on ketone bodies, including 3-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone as exposure respectively, while GWAS data on aortic dissection was used as outcome. Subsequently, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to examine the potential relationship between ketone bodies and aortic dissection. Then, reverse and multivariate Mendelian randomization analyses were performed. Additionally, sensitivity tests were conducted to assess the robustness of MR study. RESULTS: The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method of Mendelian randomization analysis of gene prediction observed a negative correlation between 3-hydroxybutyrate and risk of aortic dissection (OR 0.147, 95% CI 0.053-0.410). Furthermore, consistent findings were obtained through the implementation of the weighted median, simple mode, Mendelian randomization-Egger (MR-Egger), and weighted mode methods. After adjusting acetoacetate (OR 0.143, 95% CI 0.023-0.900) or acetone (OR 0.100, 95% CI 0.025-0.398), MR analysis of gene prediction still observed a negative correlation between 3-hydroxybutyrate and risk of aortic dissection. No indications of heterogeneity or pleiotropy among the SNPs were detected. CONCLUSION: The findings from the MR analysis demonstrated that genetically predicted 3-hydroxybutyrate exhibits a protective effect against aortic dissection.",GFAP; ENO2; NEFL,adult swine,animal,Animal – Other Mammal,"cerebral glucose uptake, down",Ion & Nutrient Transport,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Cardiac arrest,Cardiovascular,"plasma biomarkers of brain injury, down; sEEG amplitude, up","Brain injury, down; sEEG amplitude, up",sodium-ss-hydroxybutyrate (SBHB) infusion,Intravenous BHB,NS

The aim was to test the effects of sodium-ss-hydroxybutyrate (SBHB) infusion on brain injury in a clinically relevant swine model of CA. RESULTS: CA was electrically induced in 20 adult swine. After 10 min, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed for 5 min. After return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the animals were randomly assigned to receive an infusion of balanced crystalloid (controls, n = 11) or SBHB (theoretical osmolarity 1189 mOsm/l, n = 8) for 12 h. Multimodal neurological and cardiovascular monitoring were implemented in all animals. Nineteen of the 20 animals achieved ROSC. Blood sodium concentrations, osmolarity and circulating KBs were higher in the treated animals than in the controls. SBHB infusion was associated with significantly lower plasma biomarkers of brain injury at 6 (glial fibrillary acid protein, GFAP and neuron specific enolase, NSE) and 12 h (neurofilament light chain, NFL, GFAP and NSE) compared to controls. The amplitude of the stereoelectroencephalograph (sEEG) increased in treated animals after ROSC compared to controls. Cerebral glucose uptake was lower in treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: In this experimental model, SBHB infusion after resuscitated CA was associated with reduced circulating markers of cerebral injury and increased sEEG amplitude.",0,Cy/+ rats; Pkd1 (RC/RC); Pkd1-Ksp:Cre,animal,Animal – Rat; Animal – Mouse,"signaling functions, NS",Other / Unspecified,kidney,Kidney,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Polycystic kidney disease,Renal & Urological,"disease progression, down","Disease progression, down",beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

We previously demonstrated that inducing a state of ketosis ameliorates or reverses PKD progression in multiple animal models. In this study, we compare time-restricted feeding and 48-h periodic fasting regimens in both juvenile and adult Cy/+ rats. Both fasting regimens potently prevent juvenile disease progression and partially reverse PKD in adults. To explore the mechanism of fasting, we administered beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) to Cy/+ rats and orthologous mouse models of PKD (Pkd1 (RC/RC) , Pkd1-Ksp:Cre). BHB recapitulated the effects of fasting in these models independent of stereoisomer, suggesting the effects of BHB are largely due to its signaling functions.

To date, all known pathways of BHB metabolism involve interconversion of BHB and primary energy intermediates. Here we show that CNDP2 controls a previously undescribed secondary BHB metabolic pathway via enzymatic conjugation of BHB and free amino acids. This BHB-ylation reaction produces a family of endogenous ketone metabolites, the BHB-amino acids. Genetic ablation of CNDP2 in mice eliminates tissue amino acid BHB-ylation activity and reduces BHB-amino acid levels. Administration of BHB-Phe, the most abundant BHB-amino acid, to obese mice activates neural populations in the hypothalamus and brainstem and suppresses feeding and body weight. Conversely, CNDP2-KO mice exhibit increased food intake and body weight upon ketosis stimuli. CNDP2-dependent amino acid BHB-ylation and BHB-amino acid metabolites are also conserved in humans. Therefore, the metabolic pathways of BHB extend beyond primary metabolism and include secondary ketone metabolites linked to energy balance.",0,"14 healthy, male participants",human,Human – Interventional,"arterial and cerebral oxygenation, up",Multiple mechanisms,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"AMS development, down","Disease activity index (DAI), down",ketone ester (KE),Ketone ester (KE),D-BHB

Based on recent evidence that ketone ester (KE) intake attenuates hypoxemia, we investigated whether exogenous ketosis might mitigate AMS development and identified underlying physiological mechanisms. Fourteen healthy, male participants were enrolled in two 29-h protocols (simulated altitude of 4,000-4,500 m) receiving either KE or a placebo (CON) at regular timepoints throughout the protocol in a randomized, crossover manner. Physiological responses were characterized after 15 min and 4 h in hypoxia, and the protocol was terminated prematurely upon development of severe AMS (Lake Louise Score >/= 10). KE ingestion induced a consistent diurnal ketosis (d-beta-hydroxybutyrate, [betaHB] of approximately 3 mM), whereas blood [betaHB] remained low (<0.6 mM) in CON. Each participant tolerated the protocol equally long or longer (n = 6 or n = 8, respectively) in KE. Protocol duration increased by 32% on average with KE, and doubled upon KE for severe AMS-developing participants (n = 9). Relative to CON, KE induced a mild metabolic acidosis, hyperventilation, and relative sympathetic dominance. KE also inhibited the progressive hypoxemia that was observed between 15 min and 4 h in hypoxia in CON, while concomitantly increasing cerebral oxygenation and capillary Po(2) within this timeframe despite a KE-induced reduction in cerebral oxygen supply. These data indicate that exogenous ketosis attenuates AMS development. The key underlying mechanisms include improved arterial and cerebral oxygenation, in combination with lowered cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery, and increased sympathetic dominance.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Ketone ester intake attenuated the development of acute mountain sickness at a simulated altitude of 4,000-4,500 m.

To determine the neuroregenerative potential of D,L-sodium-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D/L-BHB), Sprague Dawley rat primary cortical neurons were exposed to simulated central nervous system injury using a scratch assay. The neuronal cell migration, cell density and degree of regeneration in the damaged areas (gaps) in the absence (control) and presence of BHB (2 mM) were documented with automated live-cell imaging by the CytoSMART system over 24 h, which was followed by immunocytochemistry, labeling synapsin-I and beta3-tubulin. The cell density was significantly higher in the gaps with BHB treatment after 24 h compared to the control. In the control, only 1.5% of the measured gap areas became narrower over 24 h, while in the BHB-treated samples 49.23% of the measured gap areas became narrower over 24 h. In the control, the gap expanded by 63.81% post-injury, while the gap size decreased by 10.83% in response to BHB treatment, compared to the baseline. The cell density increased by 97.27% and the gap size was reduced by 74.64% in response to BHB, compared to the control. The distance travelled and velocity of migrating cells were significantly higher with BHB treatment, while more synapsin-I and beta3-tubulin were found in the BHB-treated samples after 24 h, compared to the control. The results demonstrate that D/L-BHB enhanced neuronal migration and molecular processes associated with neural regeneration and axonogenesis.

Ketone esters (KEs) are compounds that induce hyperketonemia without dietary changes and that may impact physical and cognitive function in young adults. The functional effects of KEs have not been studied in older adults. OBJECTIVES: Our long-term goal is to examine if KEs modulate aging biology mechanisms and clinical outcomes relevant to frailty in older adults. Here, we report the exploratory functional and quality-of-life outcome measures collected during a 12-week safety and tolerability study of KE (NCT05585762). DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel-group, pilot trial of 12-weeks of daily KE ingestion. SETTING: The Clinical Research Unit at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, California. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults (>/= 65 years), independent in activities of daily living, with no unstable acute medical conditions (n = 30). INTERVENTION: Subjects were randomly allocated (1:1) to consume 25 g daily of either KE (bis-octanoyl (R)-1,3-butanediol) or a taste, appearance, and calorie-matched placebo (PLA) containing canola oil. MEASUREMENTS: Longitudinal change in physical function, cognitive function and quality of life were assessed as exploratory outcomes in n = 23 completers (n = 11 PLA, n = 12 KE). A composite functional outcome to describe the vigor-frailty continuum was calculated. Heart rate and activity was measured throughout the study using digital wearables. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant longitudinal differences between groups in exploratory functional, activity-based or quality of life outcomes. CONCLUSION: Daily ingestion of 25 g of KE did not affect exploratory functional or quality-of-life end points in this pilot cohort of healthy older adults.

However, whether and how protein Kbhb modification participates in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unknown. Herein, we carried out 4D label-free beta-hydroxybutylation quantitative proteomics using brain samples of 8-month-old and 2-month-old APP/PS1 AD model mice and wild-type (WT) controls. We identified a series of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-associated enzymes including citrate synthase (CS) and succinate-CoA ligase subunit alpha (SUCLG1), whose Kbhb modifications were decreased in APP/PS1 mice at pathological stages. Sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate (Na-beta-OHB) treatment markedly increased Kbhb modifications of CS and SUCLG1 and their enzymatic activities, leading to elevated ATP production. We further found that Kbhb modifications at lysine 393 site in CS and at lysine 81 site in SUCLG1 were crucial for their enzymatic activities. Finally, we found that beta-OHB levels were decreased in the brain of APP/PS1 mice at pathological stages. While ketogenic diet not only significantly increased beta-OHB levels, Kbhb modifications and enzymatic activities of CS and SUCLG1, and ATP production, but also dramatically attenuated beta-amyloid plaque pathologies and microgliosis in APP/PS1 mice. Together, our findings indicate the importance of protein Kbhb modification for maintaining normal TCA cycle and ATP production and provide a novel molecular mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of ketogenic diet on energy metabolism and AD intervention.",0,young adults HW; OW,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"glucose decrease, down",Metabolic Regulation,prefrontal connectomes,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"cognitive interference, down","Cognition, down",ketone monoester (395 mg/kg dose),Ketone ester (KE),NS

Metabolic indicators (blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and glucose) and neurocognitive function (causal density via functional near-infrared spectroscopy and cognitive interference via the Stroop task) were measured at baseline, 30 min, and 90 min post-supplementation. A chain mediation model was constructed to test the indirect effects of BHB level on cognitive interference through mediators like blood glucose and causal density. In the linear mixed models, significant effects were observed for trial (beta = -0.92, 0.20, -0.04, 25.53) and assessment time (beta = 0.50, -0.14, 0.09, -62.88) in BHB, glucose, causal density, and cognitive interference (p < 0.05), but not for group factors. Compared to OW, the effects of ketone monoester on prefrontal connectomes were more enduring in the HW (p < 0.05). Elevated BHB level improved cognitive function through decreasing glucose level and increasing causal density, with an estimate of -0.63. Acute ketone monoester supplementation elevated levels of blood BHB and prefrontal connectomes and decreased levels of glucose and cognitive interference, regardless of weight status.

39424350,The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate ameliorates neurodevelopmental deficits in the GABAergic system of daf-18/PTEN Caenorhabditis elegans mutants.,"A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) is essential for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which alter this equilibrium, are a common feature in various types of neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN), the main negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway, are strongly associated with ASD. However, it is unclear whether PTEN deficiencies can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, where both excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) inputs regulate muscle activity, we found that daf-18/PTEN mutations impact GABAergic (but not cholinergic) neurodevelopment and function. This selective impact results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. The defects observed in the GABAergic system in daf-18/PTEN mutants are due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO during development. Ketogenic diets (KGDs) have proven effective for disorders associated with E/I imbalances. However, the mechanisms underlying their action remain largely elusive. We found that a diet enriched with the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate during early development induces DAF-16/FOXO activity, therefore improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in daf-18/PTEN mutants. Our study provides valuable insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and delves into the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of KGDs.",0,overweight obese subjects (n=29),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"substrate metabolism, altered",Metabolic Regulation,muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Obesity; Type 2 diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"glucose tolerance, decreased or no-change; insulin sensitivity, no-change","Glucose tolerance, decreased or no-change; Insulin sensitivity, no-change","ketone ester of beta-hydroxybutyrate, 8 g every 8 hours",Multi-source,NS

These diets promote weight loss, improve glycemic control, and reduce insulin resistance. However, whether the improvements in glycemic control and insulin sensitivity are secondary to the weight loss or result from a direct effect of hyperketonemia is controversial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 29 overweight obese subjects were randomized to one of three dietary interventions for 10 days: (1) Weight-maintaining standard diet; (2) Weight-maintaining ketogenic diet; (3) Weight-maintaining ketogenic diet plus supplementation with the ketone ester of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OH-B), 8 g every 8 hours. At baseline, all subjects had oral glucose tolerance test, 2-step euglycemic insulin clamp (20 mU/m(2).min and 60 mU/m(2).min) with titrated glucose and indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: Body weight, fat content, and per cent body fat (DEXA) remained constant over the 10-day dietary intervention period in all three groups. Plasma beta-OH-B concentration increased twofold, while carbohydrate oxidation decreased, and lipid oxidation increased demonstrating the expected shifts in substrate metabolism with institution of the ketogenic diet. Glucose tolerance either decreased slightly or remained unchanged in the two ketogenic diet groups. Whole body (muscle), liver, and adipose tissue sensitivity to insulin remained unchanged in all 3 groups, as did the plasma lipid profile and blood pressure. CONCLUSION: In the absence of weight loss, a low carbohydrate ketogenic diet has no beneficial effect on glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, or other metabolic parameters.",0,T2DM patients with LV EF /=50%,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"fuel provision, up",Metabolic Regulation,left ventricle,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Multi-disease,"left ventricular function, up","Cardiac function, up",incremental infusions of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OH-B),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

Three groups of patients with T2DM (n = 12 per group) with an LV ejection fraction (EF) </=50% received incremental infusions of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OH-B) for 3-6 h to increase the plasma beta-OH-B concentration throughout the physiologic (groups I and II) and pharmacologic (group III) range. Cardiac MRI was performed at baseline and after each beta-OH-B infusion to provide measures of cardiac function. On a separate day, group II also received a sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) infusion, thus serving as their own control for time, volume, and pH. Additionally, group II underwent positron emission tomography study with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose to examine effect of hyperketonemia on MGU. Groups I, II, and III achieved plasma beta-OH-B levels (mean +/- SEM) of 0.7 +/- 0.3, 1.6 +/- 0.2, 3.2 +/- 0.2 mmol/L, respectively. Cardiac output (CO), LVEF, and stroke volume (SV) increased significantly during beta-OH-B infusion in groups II (CO, from 4.54 to 5.30; EF, 39.9 to 43.8; SV, 70.3 to 80.0) and III (CO, from 5.93 to 7.16; EF, 41.1 to 47.5; SV, 89.0 to 108.4), and did not change with NaHCO3 infusion in group II. The increase in LVEF was greatest in group III (P < 0.001 vs. group II). MGU and MBF were not altered by beta-OH-B. In patients with T2DM and LVEF </=50%, increased plasma beta-OH-B level significantly increased LV function dose dependently. Because MGU did not change, the myocardial benefit of beta-OH-B resulted from providing an additional fuel for the heart without inhibiting MGU.",INS; GIP,healthy adults,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"hormone response blunting, down",Hormonal Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",a single 12 g oral dose of D-BHB,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

We assessed the metabolism of the ketone tracer, carbon-11 acetoacetate ((11)C-AcAc), by the left and right ventricles of the heart and by the kidney using positron emission tomography (PET) in n = 10 healthy adults under four experimental conditions: a 4-h fast (fasted) +/- a single 12 g oral dose of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB), and a single complete, liquid replacement meal (hereafter referred to as the ""fed"" condition) +/- a single 12 g oral dose of D-BHB. Under these experimental conditions, the kinetics of (11)C-AcAc metabolism fitted a two-compartment model in the heart and a three-compartment model in the kidney. Plasma ketones were about 10-fold higher with the oral dose of D-BHB. During the four conditions, tracer kinetics were broadly similar in the myocardium and kidney cortex. (11)C-AcAc metabolism by the kidney pelvis was similar in three of the four study conditions but, later, peaked significantly higher than that in the cortex; the exception was that the tracer uptake was significantly lower in the fed condition without D-BHB. (11)C-AcAc uptake was significantly inversely correlated with age in the kidney cortex, and its oxidative metabolism was significantly positively correlated with age in the left ventricle. D-BHB blunted the insulin, gastric inhibitory peptide, and C-peptide response to the meal.

However, the long-term safety of the KD and the underlying mechanism by which it delays OA remain unclear. We found that while long-term KD could ameliorate OA, it induced severe hepatic steatosis in mice. Consequently, we developed 2 versions of ketogenic-based diets: KD supplemented with vitamin D and intermittent KD. Both KD supplemented with vitamin D and intermittent KD effectively alleviated OA by significantly reducing the levels of inflammatory cytokines, cartilage loss, sensory nerve sprouting, and knee hyperalgesia without inducing hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), a convenient energy carrier produced by adipocytes, could ameliorate OA without causing liver lesions. Mechanistically, beta-HB enhanced chondrocyte autophagy and reduced apoptosis through the activation of Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3) signaling pathway; a pathway which was down-regulated in the articular chondrocytes from both OA patients and mice. Collectively, our findings highlighted the potential therapeutic value of beta-HB and KD supplemented with vitamin D and intermittent KD approaches for managing OA.",CNDP2,mice; CNDP2-KO mice; humans,animal; human,Animal – Mouse; Human – Observational/Patient samples,"amino acid BHB-ylation (CNDP2-dependent enzymatic conjugation), down",Epigenetic Regulation,hypothalamus,Brain/CNS,neurons,Neural / Glial,Neurons,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Obesity,Metabolic & Endocrine,"feeding, down","Food intake, down",exogenous ketone ester supplementation; ketogenic diet,Ketone ester (KE); Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

To date, all known pathways of BHB metabolism involve the interconversion of BHB and primary energy intermediates. Here, we identify a previously undescribed BHB secondary metabolic pathway via CNDP2-dependent enzymatic conjugation of BHB and free amino acids. This BHB shunt pathway generates a family of anti-obesity ketone metabolites, the BHB-amino acids. Genetic ablation of CNDP2 in mice eliminates tissue amino acid BHB-ylation activity and reduces BHB-amino acid levels. The most abundant BHB-amino acid, BHB-Phe, is a ketosis-inducible congener of Lac-Phe that activates hypothalamic and brainstem neurons and suppresses feeding. Conversely, CNDP2-KO mice exhibit increased food intake and body weight following exogenous ketone ester supplementation or a ketogenic diet. CNDP2-dependent amino acid BHB-ylation and BHB-amino acid metabolites are also conserved in humans. Therefore, enzymatic amino acid BHB-ylation defines a ketone shunt pathway and bioactive ketone metabolites linked to energy balance.",0,patients with asthenic manifestations (ICD-10 F06; F07; R53),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"stimulation of physiological ketosis, up",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan; Asthenic disorder,Other / Unspecified; Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"cognitive functioning, up; severity of asthenia, down","Cognition, up; Fatigue severity, down",oral beta-hydroxybutyrate salts,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 86 patients with complaints of asthenic manifestations (ICD-10 diagnoses F06; F07; R53). Half of the patients were included in the study group taking beta-hydroxybutyrate salts, and the other half were included in the control group taking placebo. The duration of administration was 15 days. The content of ketones in the blood was assessed immediately before and after taking the drug on the first and last days of the study. Subjective severity of asthenia manifestations was assessed using a visual-analog scale (VAS). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the Trial Making Test (TMT) were used to assess cognitive functions. RESULTS: The control and study groups did not differ significantly in subjective and objective indicators of mental performance before taking the drug. At the end of the study, the blood ketone content in the experimental group was statistically significantly higher than in the control group. Physiological ketosis was achieved in 29 patients of the experimental group (67%). By the end of the study, the experimental group showed a significant improvement in all cognitive tests. At the same time, by the end of the study, only an improvement in TMT-A performance was noted in the control group. Also, in the experimental group, statistically significantly more patients achieved a significant improvement in mental performance on VAS tasks.

We investigate whether the elevation of plasma levels of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate, achieved through the in vivo administration of its precursor 1,3-butanediol (BD) to rats, could impact interscapular BAT (iBAT) mitochondrial biochemistry and functionality. We examined the effects induced by BD within 3 h and after 2 weeks of treatment. A large-scale quantitative proteomics approach, coupling liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, and Western blot associated with functional studies by respirometry allowed us to evaluate the changes in iBAT mitochondrial protein expression and bioenergetics induced by BD. BD administration increased beta-hydroxybutyrate plasma levels, which correlated with an enhancement in iBAT mitochondrial respiration rate, likely due to the activation of the respiratory chain and uncoupling protein-1. The proteomic analysis demonstrated that BD influenced the mitochondrial levels of specific subunits belonging to the five respiratory complexes, uncoupling protein-1, and proteins involved in propanoate metabolism. BD administration also induced lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation of mitochondrial proteins, including specific subunits of the respiratory chain complexes and uncoupling protein-1. Most of the BD-induced effects were observed within 3 h of its administration and persisted/increased after 2 weeks of treatment. In conclusion, by using BD to increase beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, we provide evidence supporting the role of beta-hydroxybutyrate as a signaling molecule capable of rapidly modulating BAT physiology by acting at the mitochondrial level.",0,mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,heart,Heart,cardiomyocyte,Muscle – Cardiac,Cardiomyocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Heart failure,Cardiovascular,"clinical features, improved","Clinical features, improved",beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS
39588043,The tRNA methyltransferase Mettl1 governs ketogenesis through translational regulation and drives metabolic reprogramming in cardiomyocyte maturation.,"After birth, the heart undergoes a shift in energy metabolism and cytoarchitecture to enhance efficient energy production and cardiac contraction, which is essential for postnatal development and growth. However, the precise mechanisms regulating this process remain elusive. Here we show that the RNA modification enzyme Mettl1 is a critical regulator of postnatal metabolic reprogramming and cardiomyocyte maturation in mice, primarily through its influence on the translation of the rate-limiting ketogenesis enzyme Hmgcs2. Our findings reveal that ketogenesis is vital for the postnatal transition of fuel from glucose to fatty acids in cardiomyocytes, achieved by modulating tricarboxylic acid cycle-related enzymatic activity via lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation protein modification. Loss of Mettl1 results in aberrant metabolic reprogramming and cardiomyocyte immaturity, leading to heart failure, although some clinical features can be rescued by beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation. Our study provides mechanistic insights into how Mettl1 regulates metabolic reprogramming in neonatal cardiomyocytes and highlights the importance of ketogenesis in cardiomyocyte maturation.",0,adult patients with PTSD receiving outpatient treatment at Southern Oslo District Psychiatric Centre (age 18–65),human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Post-traumatic stress disorder,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"PTSD symptoms, down; Quality of life, up","Anxiety-like behavior, down; Quality of life, up",ketogenic diet supplemented with beta-hydroxybutyrate salt; exogenous ketones (KD-KS),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid); Ketone salt (KS),NS

In addition to being a mental disorder, PTSD is strongly associated with a wide range of metabolic abnormalities that affect the entire body. Existing treatment options of psychotherapy and medications are often ineffective. Exploring other potential treatments is necessitated. The ketogenic diet has shown potential as a metabolic therapy in certain neurological and mental disorders and is a promising intervention in the treatment of PTSD. AIM: This study aimed to examine if a 4-week ketogenic diet intervention supplemented with exogenous ketones (KD-KS) was feasible in adult patients with PTSD, to what extent it was possible to recruit patients, attain and maintain ketosis (plasma concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) >/= 0.5 mmol/L), the occurrence of serious adverse reactions and adverse reactions to KD-KS, and acceptance of treatment. Our exploratory aims were changes in PTSD symptoms and health-related quality of life (QoL) from baseline to 4 weeks. METHODS: Patients 18 </= 65 years old, diagnosed with PTSD, and receiving outpatient treatment for PTSD at Southern Oslo District Psychiatric Centre (DPC), Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, were included. The intervention consisted of a ketogenic diet supplemented with beta-hydroxybutyrate salt to obtain ketosis. PTSD symptoms were measured with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and QoL was measured with the RAND 36-Item Health Survey 1.0. RESULTS: During a 21-week inclusion period, three of four eligible patients (75% [95% CI: 30 to 95%]) were included. Two patients (67% [95% CI: 21 to 94%]) completed the 4-week intervention and one patient (33% [95% CI: 6 to 79%]) completed 2 weeks of intervention before discontinuing. Ketosis was achieved on day 1 in one patient, and on day 2 in two patients, and was maintained in 87% of the intervention. There were no serious adverse reactions. Adverse reactions were reported in a total of 70% of intervention days, the most frequent being headache followed by fatigue. The participant-perceived degree of adverse reactions was low to moderate. The treatment was accepted by patients on all intervention days. PCL-5 decreased by 20 points (70 to 50) in patient 1 and by 10 points (50 to 40) in patient 2, from baseline to 4 weeks, which is a reliable and clinically meaningful improvement. QoL improved in six of eight RAND-36 subscales in patient 1 and three of eight in patient 2. Patient 3 did not complete assessments after week 2. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this feasibility study is the first study examining a ketogenic diet intervention in patients with PTSD. Three of four predefined feasibility criteria were achieved. Ketosis was attained fast and maintained, patients were compliant and there were clinically meaningful improvements in PTSD symptoms and QoL. Despite the small sample size, the knowledge obtained in this study is important for the planning of future studies with ketogenic diet interventions in this patient group. It is a first step for potential dietary and metabolic therapies in PTSD. Further feasibility and pilot studies with larger sample sizes are needed to determine feasibility and safety before planning future randomised controlled trials investigating an effect.

Exogenous administration of ketones has profound systemic anti-inflammatory effects and produces several nutrient-signaling and metabolic effects that may benefit multiple organ systems affected in pwCF. This pilot study was designed to determine the feasibility of administration of a ketone monoester (KME) to increase circulating D-beta hydroxybutyrate concentrations (D-betaHB) and to improve subjective measures of CF-specific quality of life and markers of inflammation in serum and sputum in adults with CF. METHODS: Fourteen participants receiving modulator therapy were randomized to receive either KME (n = 9) or placebo control (PC, n = 5) for 5-7 days during hospitalization for treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbation or as outpatients under standard care. RESULTS: The KME was well tolerated, with only mild reports of gastrointestinal distress. D-betaHB concentrations increased from 0.2 +/- 0.1 mM to 1.6 +/- 0.6 mM in the KME group compared to 0.2 +/- 0.0 to 0.3 +/- 0.1 in the PC group (p = 0.011) within 15 min following consumption and remained elevated, relative to baseline, for over 2 h. Pulmonary function was not altered after single- or short-term KME administration, but participants in the KME group self-reported higher subjective respiratory scores compared to PC in both cases (p = 0.031). Plasma inflammatory markers were not statistically different between groups following the short-term (5-7 d) intervention (p > 0.05). However, an exploratory analysis of plasma pre- and post-IL-6 concentrations was significant (p = 0.028) in the KME group but not PC. Sputum IFNgamma (p = 0.057), IL-12p70 (p = 0.057), IL-1beta (p = 0.100), IL-15 (p = 0.057), IL-1alpha (p = 0.114), and MPO (p = 0.133) were lower in the KME group compared to PC but did not achieve statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: With the emerging role of exogenous ketones as nutrient signaling molecules and mediators of metabolism, we showed that KME is well tolerated, increases circulating D-betaHB concentrations, and produces outcomes that justify the need for large-scale clinical trials to investigate the role of KME on whole-body and tissue lipid accumulation and inflammation in pwCF.",0,C57BL/6N mice; letrozole-induced PCOS mouse model; KGN cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"cGAS-STING pathway inhibition, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,ovaries,Ovary,KGN cells,Unspecified / Mixed,Cell line (origin unclear),mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Polycystic ovary syndrome,Reproductive & Pregnancy,"ovarian functions, up","Ovarian function, up",used to treat KGN cells; ketone bodies produced from KD administration,NS; Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

The ketogenic diet (KD), a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrates, has been applied clinically for the treatment of obese women with PCOS. We have previously demonstrated that KD improved the reproductive phenotype in an androgen-induced PCOS mouse model, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of KD on the reproductive phenotype of a letrozole-induced PCOS mouse model. METHODS: Female C57BL/6N mice were divided into three groups, designated control, letrozole, and letrozole + KD groups. Mice of control and letrozole groups were fed the control diet, whereas letrozole + KD mice were fed a KD with 89.9% (kcal) fat for 3 weeks after the PCOS mouse model was generated. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the most abundant ketone body in the body, was used to treat KGN cells with testosterone (T) to simulate the KD effect on PCOS mouse ovaries in vitro. RESULTS: Our data showed that KD treatment significantly increased blood ketone levels and reduced body weight. Ovarian functions were improved in some letrozole + KD mice. Results from in vitro experiments indicated mitochondrial damage owing to high T levels, which resulted in the leakage of cytochrome C and mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol and thus induced the activation of the intracellular caspase cascade and the cGAS-STING-NF-kappaB pathway, leading to granulosa cell inflammation and apoptosis. BHB exhibited certain protective effects on mitochondria of T-treated KGN cells via inhibiting the cGAS-STING pathway. Moreover, the cGAS-STING pathway was activated in ovaries of letrozole mice and was down-regulated in letrozole + KD mice. CONCLUSION: These findings, for the first time, revealed that hyperandrogenism induced ovarian dysfunction possibly through activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, which could be partially inhibited by ketone bodies produced from KD administration.",IL1B,rats; THP-1-derived macrophages,animal; in vitro,Animal – Rat; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"inflammatory responses, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,joint,Connective tissue/Stroma,macrophages,Hematopoietic / Immune,Macrophages,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Bleeding-induced arthropathy,Musculoskeletal & Connective Tissue,"joint swelling, down; periarticular tissue-fibrosis, down","Inflammation, down; Fibrosis, down",ketogenic diet,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS

It has been known that concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in blood are increased by a ketogenic diet, and elevated levels of circulating BHB restricts the progression of inflammation-mediated joint pathological changes. We hypothesized that elevation of blood BHB concentrations could be effective for reducing the progression of bleeding-induced arthropathy by moderating the inflammatory responses of macrophages. In this study, we investigated whether BHB alleviates the arthropathy caused by repeated intra-articular blood injection in rats. To increase blood BHB levels, rats were fed with ketogenic diet. Repeated intra-articular blood injection induced significant joint swelling, whereas ketogenic diet intake significantly increased blood BHB concentrations and ameliorated the joint swelling. The periarticular tissue-fibrosis observed in the control diet intake group appeared to be significantly alleviated in the ketogenic diet intake group. In addition, the IL-1beta, which is involved in the progression of arthropathy, levels in the supernatants of blood-exposed macrophages derived from THP-1 cell line were significantly suppressed by BHB supplementation. In summary, BHB moderated the pathological joint changes caused by intra-articular blood exposure.",APP; 0,mouse; nematode,animal,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Invertebrate,"protein insolubility, up",Other / Unspecified,mouse brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"amyloid-beta aggregation toxicity, down","Amyloid-beta toxicity, down",ketone ester,Ketone ester (KE),NS

We identify beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), a ketone body, as a regulator of protein solubility. betaHB primarily provides ATP substrate during periods of reduced glucose availability, and regulates other cellular processes through protein interactions. We demonstrate betaHB-induced protein insolubility is not dependent on covalent protein modification, pH, or solute load, and is observable in mouse brain in vivo after delivery of a ketone ester. This mechanism is selective for pathological proteins such as amyloid-beta, and exogenous betaHB ameliorates pathology in nematode models of amyloid-beta aggregation toxicity. We generate libraries of the betaHB-induced protein insolublome using mass spectrometry proteomics, and identify common protein domains and upstream regulators. We show enrichment of neurodegeneration-related proteins among betaHB targets and the clearance of these targets from mouse brain.

39636949,beta-Hydroxybutyrate suppresses M1 macrophage polarization through beta-hydroxybutyrylation of the STAT1 protein.,"beta-Hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), the primary ketone body, is a bioactive metabolite that acts as both an energy substrate and a signaling molecule. Recent studies found that beta-OHB inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, but its underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb), a post-translational modification mediated by beta-OHB, plays a key role in regulating the expression and activity of modified proteins. However, whether macrophages undergo protein Kbhb and whether Kbhb modification regulates macrophage polarization remains largely unknown. In this study, treatment with beta-OHB and ketone ester significantly decreased the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced enhancement of the M1 phenotype of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), RAW264.7 cells, and peritoneal macrophages (PMs) in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, beta-OHB treatment induced global protein Kbhb, which is associated with the regulation of macrophage M1 polarization. Proteome-wide Kbhb analysis in beta-OHB-treated BMDMs revealed 3469 Kbhb modification sites within 1549 proteins, among which interleukin-12-responding proteins were significantly upregulated. Our results indicated that beta-OHB regulated M1 macrophage polarization by inducing Kbhb modification of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) K679 site, which inhibited its LPS-induced phosphorylation and transcription. Altogether, our study demonstrated the presence of a widespread Kbhb landscape in the beta-OHB-treated macrophages and provided novel insights into the anti-inflammatory effects of beta-OHB.",IL1B; TNF; CCL2,collagenase-induced ICH in rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"inflammation, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hemorrhagic stroke,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"neurological deficit, improved (early); edema, no-change; brain lesion volume, no-change; forelimb use asymmetry, no-change","Neurological deficit score, improved (early); Pulmonary edema, no-change; Brain injury, no-change; Motor function, no-change","250 mg/kg, subcutaneously every 12 hours",Subcutaneous BHB,NS

Because of this, exogenous ketone supplementation has been used to help treat various diseases. beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) is the major ketone body that has reduced neurological injury and brain edema in animal models of ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury. However, the therapeutic potential of betaHB in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has not yet been determined. Here we investigated the effects of exogenous betaHB treatment following ICH on inflammation, edema, injury size, and functional outcomes. To do this, we administered 250 mg/kg of betaHB (subcutaneously every 12 hours) starting 2 hours after collagenase-induced ICH in rats over 3 experiments. First, we observed that betaHB-treated rats had significant reductions in transcript expression of pro-inflammatory markers Il1b (p = 0.0210), Tnfa (p = 0.0108), and Mcp1 (p = 0.0473) 3 days post-ICH. Second, betaHB significantly improved neurological deficits measured by the neurological deficit scale on day 3 (p = 0.0416) in another cohort of rats, despite no treatment effect on edema (p = 0.2110). To test whether the effects of acute betaHB treatment (for 7 days post-ICH) were chronically sustained, the third experiment used serial behavioural testing which confirmed that betaHB significantly improved neurological deficit scores (p = 0.0459) 3 days post-ICH. These effects were not sustained at 7, 14, and 28 days post-ICH (all p>/=0.1546). Similarly, betaHB treatment did not yield differences in forelimb use asymmetry (all p>0.45) or brain lesion volume (p = 0.3381), the primary endpoint of this study. Thus, our studies show that an acute betaHB treatment post-ICH can provide some early signs of functional benefit without evidence of lasting effects or neuroprotection. However, it remains to be tested whether other betaHB dosing regimens may favorably affect these and other neurological, behavioral, and biochemical parameters, particularly given the early signals of reduced striatal inflammation.",APP; NLRP3; IL1B,5xFAD Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse; previous in vitro study,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; NS,"phagocytosis, up",Inflammation & Immune Response,brain,Brain/CNS,microglia,Neural / Glial,Microglia,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"hippocampal long-term depression, improved","Depressive-like behavior, improved",intraperitoneal injection of BHB (250 mg/kg),Intraperitoneal BHB,NS

Our previous in vitro study showed that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a major ketone body, reverses pathological features of amyloid-beta oligomer (AbetaO)-activated microglia. Here we tested the in vivo effects of BHB on microglia and synaptic plasticity in the 5xFAD Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. A short 1-week regimen of daily intraperitoneal injection of BHB (250 mg/kg), which induced brief and mild daily episodic ketosis, was sufficient to mitigate pro-inflammatory microglia activation and reduce brain amyloid-beta deposition by enhancing phagocytosis. Remarkably, it mitigated the deficits of hippocampal long-term depression but not long-term potentiation, and this effect was linked to suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome-generated IL-1beta. As ketogenic diets are known for poor compliance, our study opens the possibility for alternative approaches such as short-term BHB injections or dietary ketone esters that are less restrictive, potentially safer, and easier for compliance.",KL,male rats,animal,Animal – Rat,"Kl upregulation, up",Other / Unspecified,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"oxidative stress, decreased","Oxidative stress, decreased",KD,Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
39697898,The possible antioxidative effects of ketogenic diet by modifying brain klotho expression: a rat model study.,"Objectives: The ketogenic diet (KD) has long been used as an alternative nonpharmacological therapy to manage pharmacoresistant epilepsy. The anticonvulsant mechanisms of KD have yet to be fully elucidated. The present study explored whether a KD could exert antioxidative effects by altering brain Klotho (Kl) gene expression.Methods: Thirty male rats were divided into three groups: the normal diet (ND) group received standard rat chow; the calorie-restricted diet (CRD) group was maintained at 90% of the calculated energy need; and the KD group received a diet composed of 8% protein, 2% carbohydrates, and 90% fat (per calorie macronutrient). The levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in the serum, Kl gene expression in the brain, and Kl protein, malondialdehyde (MDA), and protein carbonyl (PC) levels in the serum and brain were evaluated by standard methods.Results: The serum BHB levels in the KD group were significantly greater than those in the ND and CRD groups (p < 0.001). The Kl expression in the brain was significantly greater in the KD group than in the ND group (p = 0.028). The brain MDA levels in the KD group were significantly lower than those in the ND group (p = 0.006). Elevated BHB was positively correlated with brain Kl expression (r = 0.668, p < 0.001). The brain MDA levels were negatively correlated with brain Kl expression (r = -0.531, p = 0.003) and serum BHB levels (r = 0.472, p = 0.020).Discussion: KD might exert antioxidative effects by increasing BHB and upregulating Kl in the brain.

39728460,Ketogenic Diet Reduces Age-Induced Chronic Neuroinflammation in Mice.,"The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is an acidic energy metabolite that is synthesized during periods of fasting or exercise. Our previous study demonstrated that an every other week cyclic ketogenic diet (Cyclic KD), which induces blood BHB levels similar to those observed during fasting, reduces midlife mortality and improves memory in aging mice. In addition to its canonical role as an energy metabolite, BHB regulates gene expression and inflammatory activation through non-energetic signaling pathways. The precise mechanisms by which BHB or KD affects brain function during aging remain incompletely understood. Using bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq), we examined whole brain gene expression of 12-month-old C57BL/6JN male mice fed KD for either one week or 14 months. While one-week KD increases some inflammatory gene expression, the 14-month Cyclic KD largely reduces age-induced neuroinflammatory gene expression. Next, a gene expression analysis of human primary brain cells (microglia, astrocytes, and neurons) using RNA-Seq revealed that BHB alone induces a mild level of inflammation in all three cell types. However, BHB inhibits the more pronounced inflammatory gene expression induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in microglia. BHB exhibits a comparable inhibitory effect on LPS-induced inflammation in mouse primary microglia, which we used as an in vitro model to test and exclude known mechanisms by which BHB regulates inflammation and gene expression as responsible for this modulation of LPS-induced inflammatory gene expression. An acidic milieu resulting from BHB may be required for or contribute to the effect. Overall, we observe that BHB has the potential to attenuate the microglial response to inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS. This may contribute to an observed reduction in chronic inflammation in the brain following long-term Cyclic KD treatment in aging mice.",0,murine muscle cell culture,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse,"mitochondrial function, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,muscle,Skeletal muscle,muscle cells,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Gout; Metabolic syndrome,Metabolic & Endocrine,"inflammation, down; insulin sensitivity, up","Inflammation, down; Insulin sensitivity, up",produced during fasting or carbohydrate restriction,Fasting / Caloric restriction (endogenous),NS
39746795,The Role of Beta-Hydroxybutyrate in Mitigating the Inflammatory and Metabolic Consequences of Uric Acid.,"Background: Uric acid (UA), a metabolite of purine and fructose metabolism, is linked to inflammation and metabolic disorders, including gout and cardiovascular disease. Its pro-inflammatory effects are largely driven by the activation of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, leading to increased cytokine production. Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone produced during fasting or carbohydrate restriction, has been shown to reduce inflammation. This study explores the role of BHB in mitigating the inflammatory and metabolic effects of elevated uric acid levels. Methods: We utilized a murine muscle cell culture treated with UA and BHB. Results: Muscle cells treated with UA had increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced cell viability. Co-treatment with BHB reversed these effects, improving cell survival and reducing cytokine levels. Additionally, uric acid impaired mitochondrial function and increased oxidative stress, which were mitigated by BHB. Furthermore, uric acid disrupted insulin signaling, but BHB co-treatment restored insulin sensitivity. Conclusions: These findings suggest that BHB holds therapeutic potential by counteracting the inflammatory and metabolic disruptions caused by elevated uric acid, making it a promising target for conditions such as hyperuricemia and metabolic syndrome.",CAMKK2,C57BL/6J mice; HK-2 cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"ferroptosis, down",Cell Death & Survival,kidney,Kidney,HK-2 cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Diabetic kidney disease,Renal & Urological,"kidney injury, decreased","Kidney function, decreased",NS,NS,NS
39763881,Dapagliflozin improves diabetic kidney disease by inhibiting ferroptosis through beta-hydroxybutyrate production.,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Sodium-glucose cotransporter protein 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are antihyperglycemic agents that provide additional renal-protective effects in patients with DKD, independent of their glucose-lowering effects. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study hypothesized that SGLT2i could alleviate diabetic kidney injury by inhibiting ferroptosis and explored its potential mechanisms. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into the control, DKD, DKD+dapagliflozin, and DKD+insulin treatment groups. Blood glucose levels and body weight were monitored. Renal function, tissue pathology, mitochondrial morphology and function, and lipid peroxidation biomarkers (lipid peroxidation [LPO], malondialdehyde [MDA], glutathione peroxidase 4 [GPX4], glutathione [GSH], and cystine transporter solute carrier family 7 member 11 [SLC7A11]) were evaluated. Human proximal tubule cells (HK2 cells) were exposed to high glucose alone or in combination with dapagliflozin. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level, NAD+/NADH ratio (oxidized/reduced ratio of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), and lipid peroxidation were measured. In addition, the role of the beta-hydroxybutyrate- Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase 2 (BHB-CaMKK2) axis in mediating dapagliflozin regulating ferroptosis was examined. RESULTS: Dapagliflozin significantly ameliorated kidney injury in mice with DKD. Typical changes in ferroptosis, including lipid peroxidation and impaired antioxidant capacity, increased in mice with DKD and HG-treated HK-2 cells. Dapagliflozin significantly improves ferroptosis-related lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, dapagliflozin suppressed the expression of CaMKK2, a key ferroptosis regulator. Specific CaMKK2 inhibitors alleviated mitochondrial damage and ferroptosis, whereas a CaMKK2 agonist counteracted the protective effects of dapagliflozin against mitochondrial, antioxidant, and anti-ferroptosis effects. In addition, dapagliflozin increased BHB production, which mediates its nephroprotective effects. CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin improves DKD by inhibiting ferroptosis, promoting BHB production, and regulating CaMKK2.",HMGCS2; PTPRC; LCP1; 0,NS,NS,NS,"histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation, up",Epigenetic Regulation,kidney,Kidney,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Hypertension,Cardiovascular,"hypertension, down","Hypertension, down",NS,NS,NS
39786965,The ketone body beta-Hydroxybutyrate mediated epigenetic chromatin beta-hydroxybutyrylation protects kidneys.,"Starvation, intermittent fasting and exercise, all of which are recommended lifestyle modifiers share a common metabolic signature, ketogenesis to generate the ketone bodies, predominantly beta-hydroxybutyrate. beta-hydroxybutyrate exerts beneficial effects across various contexts, preventing or mitigating disease. We hypothesized that these dynamic health benefits of beta-hydroxybutyrate might stem from its ability to regulate genome architecture through chromatin remodeling via histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation, thereby influencing the transcriptome. Focusing on the kidney, which is an end organ protected by beta-hydroxybutyrate, we examined histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation-mediated chromatin remodeling. Notably, regions of the genome associated with lipid catabolism were predominantly in an open chromatin configuration, leading to active transcription and translation. Significant beta-hydroxybutyrylation was observed in the kidneys and the most highly upregulated gene actively transcribed and translated was 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl CoA Synthase 2 ( Hmgcs2 ), a gene responsible for the biosynthesis of beta-hydroxybutyrate in mitochondria. In contrast, regions with more compact chromatin structures were enriched with genes related to immune function such as protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C ( Ptprc ) and lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 ( Lcp1 ), which exhibited reduced transcription and translation. These results reveal that renal epigenetic histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation, which concurrently modulates both energy metabolism and immune function is a mechanism underlying the dynamic health effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate to protect kidneys and lower hypertension.",0,trained triathletes; competitive triathletes,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"R-beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, down",Metabolic Regulation,muscle,Skeletal muscle,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"NS, nan","NS, nan",NS,NS,NS
39796543,Carbohydrate ingestion eliminates hypoglycemia and improves endurance exercise performance in triathletes adapted to very low- and high-carbohydrate isocaloric diets.,"Very-low-carbohydrate diets (LCHF; <50 g/day) have been debated for their potential to lower pre-exercise muscle and liver glycogen stores and metabolic efficiency, risking premature fatigue. It is also hypothesized that carbohydrate ingestion during prolonged exercise delays fatigue by increasing carbohydrate oxidation, thereby sparing muscle glycogen. Leveraging a randomized crossover design, we evaluated performance during strenuous time-to-exhaustion (70% V̇o(2max)) tests in trained triathletes following 6-wk high-carbohydrate (HCLF, 380 g/day) or very-low-carbohydrate (LCHF, 40 g/day) diets to determine 1) if adoption of the LCHF diet impairs time-to-exhaustion performance, 2) whether carbohydrate ingestion (10 g/h) 6-12x lower than current CHO fueling recommendations during low glycogen availability (>15-h pre-exercise overnight fast and/or LCHF diet) improves time to exhaustion by preventing exercise-induced hypoglycemia (EIH; <3.9 mmol/L; <70 mg/dL), and 3) the ""keto-adaptation"" time course through continuous substrate monitoring while caloric intake, physical activity, and fat-free mass are maintained. Time-to-exhaustion performance was similar across both dietary interventions. Minimal carbohydrate supplementation prevented EIH and significantly increased time to exhaustion equivalently in LCHF and HCLF interventions (22%). The LCHF diet significantly lowered 24-h glucose concentrations, which normalized after 4 wk, at the same timepoint peak blood ketone (R-beta-hydroxybutyrate) concentrations normalized. These findings 1) demonstrate that an LCHF diet sustains strenuous endurance performance, 2) establish that minimal carbohydrate supplementation was sufficient to enhance exercise performance on LCHF and HCLF diets by mitigating EIH, and 3) indicate that a minimum 4-wk adaptation period to an LCHF diet is required to ensure normalization of metabolic homeostasis, glycemic control, and exercise performance.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study examines the belief that very-low-carbohydrate diets (LCHF) impair prolonged exercise performance during strenuous exercise by comparing it with high-carbohydrate diets in competitive triathletes. After 6-wk diet adaptation, time-to-exhaustion (TTE) performance was similar across both diets. Minimal carbohydrate supplementation (10 g/h) during exercise eliminated exercise-induced hypoglycemia and improved TTE by 22% on both diets. These findings suggest that LCHF diets do not impair exercise performance and require a 4-wk adaptation period for metabolic homeostasis.",HSPA5; DDIT3; ALPL,ApoE(-/-) mice; rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs),animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Rat,"ERS-mediated apoptosis, down",Cell Death & Survival,aorta,Vasculature,vascular smooth muscle cells,Muscle – Smooth / Perivascular,Visceral smooth muscle,endoplasmic reticulum,Endoplasmic Reticulum,Unspecified,Atherosclerosis,Cardiovascular,"calcification severity, down","Calcification severity, down",supplemented with BHB,NS,NS

However, whether BHB can influence AC is still unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, ApoE(-/-) mice, fed a Western diet, were used to examine the effects of BHB on AC. Rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were used to verify the impacts of BHB on AC and to explore the underlying mechanisms. The results show that Western diet-challenged ApoE(-/-) mice, supplemented with BHB for 24 weeks, exhibited reduced calcified areas, calcium content, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in the aortas, as well as ameliorated severity of AC. Furthermore, BHB downregulated the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), thereby reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and ERS-mediated apoptosis in the aortas of the mice. Consistently, in vitro studies showed that BHB reduced ALP activity and calcium content in VSMCs, and inhibited VSMC calcification. Additionally, BHB suppressed ERS-mediated apoptosis in VSMCs. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the present results demonstrate that BHB can alleviate atherosclerotic calcification by inhibiting ERS-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, BHB may serve as a viable therapeutic agent for AC.",BDNF; BACE1,adults with T2D; C57BL/6J mice (with and without insulin resistance),human; animal,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Animal – Mouse,"BDNF expression, no-change",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,cortex,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Type 2 diabetes mellitus,Metabolic & Endocrine,"cognition, no-change; recognition memory, no-change","Cognition, no-change; Memory (general), no-change",exogenous ketone monoester,Ketone ester (KE),NS

Parallel human (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04194450, ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT05155410) and rodent trials were conducted to characterize the effect of acute and short-term exogenous ketone supplementation on indices of brain health. First, we aimed to investigate the effect of acute and short-term supplementation of exogenous ketone monoester on circulating BDNF and cognition in adults with T2D. There were no effects of ketone supplementation on plasma BDNF or cognition. Second, we aimed to investigate the mechanistic effects of acute and chronic beta-OHB supplementation on cortical BDNF content and recognition memory in C57BL/6J mice with and without insulin resistance. Acutely, beta-OHB did not alter recognition memory or BDNF content. Similarly, chronic beta-OHB supplementation did not alter recognition memory or BDNF content.

The secondary aims were to assess the effects of K(me) ingestion on markers of cardiac hemodynamics, muscle oxygenation, and vascular function at rest, during and following step-incremental cycling. We undertook a double-blind, randomized, crossover design study in 13 adults [age, 66 +/- 10 yr; body mass index (BMI), 31.3 +/- 7.0 kg.m(-2)] with T2D.

Moreover, BHB derivatives as ketone esters alleviate heart failure. Here, we provide evidence of the potential therapeutic effect of BHB on Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a rare condition characterized by premature aging and heart failure, caused by the presence of progerin, the aberrant protein derived from LMNA/C gene c.1824C > T mutation. We have assessed several hallmarks of HGPS-senescent phenotype in vitro, such as progerin levels, nuclear morphometric aberrations, nucleolar expansion, cellular senescent morphology, SA-betaGal-positive cells, H3K9me3 heterochromatin, gammaH2AX foci, Lamin B1, p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p16(CDKN2A) abundance, and autophagy. Strikingly, BHB improved nuclear and nucleolar morphometrics, diminished the senescence-phenotype, and unstuck autophagy in HGPS as observed by an enhanced degradation of the cargo protein receptor SQSTM1/p62, suggesting the stimulation of the autophagic flux. Additionally, we observed a decrease in progerin abundance, the cause of senescence in HGPS. Furthermore, compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, and SBI-0206965, an inhibitor of ULK1/2 and AMPK, which prevent autophagy activation, reversed BHB-induced progerin decline as well as its anti-senescent effect in an AMPK-mTORC1 dependent manner.

This is facilitated by cytokine-induced insulin resistance, which simultaneously promotes the mobilization of lipids and carbohydrates while limiting their consumption in immune-unrelated processes, such as development, growth, and reproduction. However, this adaptation also restricts the availability of nutrients to vital organs, which must then be sustained by alternative fuels. Here, we employed an experimental model of severe bacterial infection in Drosophila melanogaster to investigate whether ketogenesis may represent a metabolic adaptation for overcoming periods of nutritional scarcity during the immune response. We found that the immune response to severe bacterial infection is accompained by increased ketogenesis in the fat body and macrophages, leading to elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate in circulation. Although this metabolic adaptation is essential for survival during infection, it is not required for the elimination of the pathogen itself.

Targeted suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome shows promise in reducing macrophage inflammatory disruptions. However, challenges such as drug off-target effects and degradation via lysosomal capture remain during treatment. In this study, engineered apoptotic bodies (BHB-dABs) derived from adipose stem cells loaded with beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) were synthesized via biosynthesis. These vesicles target M1-type macrophages, which highly express the folic acid receptor in the inflammatory microenvironment, and facilitate lysosomal escape through 1,2-distearoyl-sn-propyltriyl-3-phosphatidylethanolamine-polyethylene glycol functionalization, which may enhance the efficacy of NLRP3 inhibition for managing diabetic wounds. In vitro studies demonstrated the biocompatibility of BHB-dABs, their selective targeting of M1-type macrophages, and their ability to release BHB within the inflammatory microenvironment via folic acid and folic acid receptor signaling. These nanovesicles exhibited lysosomal escape, anti-inflammatory, mitochondrial protection, and endothelial cell vascularization properties. In vivo experiments demonstrated that BHB-dABs enhance the recovery of diabetic wound inflammation and angiogenesis, accelerating wound healing.

39873669,Optimizing oral 3-hydroxybutyrate dosage using pharmacokinetic model to improve cognitive function and mood in healthy subjects.,"INTRODUCTION: The brain uses ketones, mainly 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB), as an alternative energy source. Therefore, oral intake of 3-HB may help maintain brain health. Previous studies indicated that achieving a maximum concentration (C(max)) of 3-HB in plasma at 0.28 mM could initiate ketone metabolism in the brain; we hypothesized that attaining this C(max) would improve brain health. METHODS: We aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of an optimized single oral dose of 3-HB on cognitive function and mood through two clinical studies: a pharmacokinetic study and an efficacy study. In the pharmacokinetic study, healthy subjects were ingested 2 and 4 g of 3-HB to construct a compartment model to predict the minimum oral dose of 3-HB needed to achieve the target C(max). In the efficacy study, a randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled crossover trial, the effects of 3-HB at the predicted doses on cognitive function and mood in healthy subjects were assessed by a serial arithmetic test (SAT), the cognitrax, the profile of mood states 2nd edition (POMS2), and fatigue visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: In the pharmacokinetic study, a one-compartment model that includes saturable and non-saturable absorption pathways, constant biosynthesis, and the linear elimination of 3-HB after oral administration were constructed. The model principally reflected the observed serum 3-HB concentrations profiles and predicted a minimum dose of 3.5 g needed to achieve the target C(max). In the efficacy study, although no significant difference was observed in any cognitive domains assessed by the Cognitrax, total responses and correct answers in the SAT were significantly improved in the active group receiving 3.5 g of 3-HB compared to the placebo group. Regarding the POMS2, confusion-bewilderment, fatigue-inertia, vigor-activity, and total mood disturbance scales were significantly improved in the active group compared to the placebo group. Additionally, fatigue VAS were also significantly improved in the active group compared to the placebo group. DISCUSSION: We successfully established a one-compartment model for oral 3-HB intake and demonstrated partial efficacy on cognitive function and broad efficacy on mood in healthy subjects with a single oral dose of 3.5 g of 3-HB optimized by the model.

39887648,Targeting Ketone Body Metabolism Improves Cardiac Function and Hemodynamics in Patients With Heart Failure: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"CONTEXT: The impacts of elevated ketone body levels on cardiac function and hemodynamics in patients with heart failure (HF) remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The effects of ketone intervention on these parameters in patients with HF were evaluated quantitatively in this meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases for relevant studies published from inception to April 13, 2024. Ketone therapy included ketone ester and beta-hydroxybutyrate intervention. DATA EXTRACTION: Seven human studies were included for the quantitative analysis. DATA ANALYSIS: Our results showed that ketone therapy significantly improved left ventricular ejection fraction (standardized mean difference, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.25-0.80]; I2 = 0%), cardiac output (0.84 [95% CI, 0.36-1.32]; I2 = 68%) and stroke volume (0.47 [95% CI, 0.10-0.84]; I2 = 39%), and significantly reduced systemic vascular resistance (-0.92 [95% CI, -1.52 to -0.33]; I2 = 74%) without influencing mean arterial pressure (-0.09 [95% CI: -0.40 to 0.22]; I2 = 0%) in patients with HF. Subgroup analysis revealed that the enhanced cardiac function and favorable hemodynamic effects of ketone therapy were also applicable to individuals without HF. CONCLUSIONS: Ketone therapy may significantly improve cardiac systolic function and hemodynamics in patients with HF and in patients without HF, suggesting it may be a promising treatment for patients with HF and also a beneficial medical strategy for patients without HF or healthy individuals.",0,WT mice; UUO; proximal tubular cells,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; In vitro – Primary cells,"epithelial-mesenchymal transition, down","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",kidney,Kidney,proximal tubular cells,Epithelial – Renal & Urothelial,Renal tubular epithelial,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Renal fibrosis,Renal & Urological,"renal fibrosis, down; inflammation, down","Fibrosis, down; Inflammation, down",BHB precursor; BHB,NS,NS

PPARalpha is a crucial transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism and inflammation. Here, we examine whether a novel selective PPARalpha modulator, pemafibrate modulates renal injury in a model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Administration of pemafibrate to wild-type (WT) mice led to reduction of renal dysfunction and fibrosis after UUO with accompanying increases in plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 and ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Treatment of WT mice with FGF21 or BHB precursor resulted in attenuation of renal fibrotic and inflammatory responses after UUO. Treatment of proximal tubular cells with FGF21 or BHB reduced expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. These findings suggest that pemafibrate could ameliorate renal damage, at least in part, by its abilities to increase the production of FGF21 and BHB.",0,healthy Japanese adults,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"NS, nan",Other / Unspecified,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"sleep quality, improved","Sleep quality, improved",d-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (D-BHB),Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

39976785,beta-Hydroxybutyrate Facilitates Postinfarction Cardiac Repair via Targeting PHD2.,"BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) remains one of the major causes of death worldwide, and innovative treatment strategies for MI represent a major challenge in cardiovascular medicine. Caloric restriction (CR) is the most potent nonpharmacological intervention known to prevent age-related disorders and extend lifespan. CR reduces glycolysis and elevates ketone body metabolism. However, whether and how CR or ketone body prevents the progression of MI remains poorly defined. METHODS: Mice treated with CR and beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) underwent MI induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiographic measurements. Histological analysis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and immunofluorescence were used to assess myocardial neovascularization and macrophage filtration. The interaction and modification of beta-OHB on PHD2 were analyzed by molecular docking, cellular thermal shift assay, liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, and coimmunoprecipitation. Macrophage-specific PHD2 K239R and K385R knock-in mice were used to determine the functional significance of beta-OHB/PHD2 axis in vivo. RESULTS: Twelve weeks of CR markedly rescued postinfarction cardiac function by enhancing neovascularization. CR significantly increased circulating and cardiac ketone bodies, including beta-OHB and acetoacetate. We identified beta-OHB but not acetoacetate selectively targeted macrophages to stimulate VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) production in the peri-infarct area to promote neovascularization and cardiac repair. Mechanistically, beta-OHB binds to and induces lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation of PHD2 at lysines 239 and 385, thus blocking its function in the hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha (hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha) and resulting in enhanced HIF1alpha-dependent VEGF transcription and secretion. More importantly, specific PHD2 lys239 and lys385 mutations in macrophages abolished the preventive effects of exogenous beta-OHB on MI in mice. CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal a novel regulation of lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation on PHD2 and demonstrate a promising and therapeutic role for beta-OHB/PHD2 in effectively accelerating neovascularization and preserving heart function after cardiac ischemia.",CXCL8; IL17A; CCL2,ARPE-19 cells,in vitro,In vitro – Immortalized cell line,"anti-inflammatory effect, NS",Inflammation & Immune Response,retinal pigment epithelium,Eye/Retina,ARPE-19 cells,Epithelial – Skin & Eye,Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE),NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Hyperglycemia,Metabolic & Endocrine,"cell viability, up; cell cycle arrest, down; inflammation, NS; cell migration/wound healing, NS","Cell viability, up; Cell cycle arrest, down; Inflammation, NS; Wound healing, NS",NS,NS,NS
40004969,beta-Hydroxybutyrate mitigates the detrimental effects of high glucose in human retinal pigment epithelial ARPE-19 cells.,"High glucose leads to cellular damage and dysfunction in the retina. Dietary interventions, including the use of ketogenic diets, have been explored for their potential to reduce the adverse effects of hyperglycemia. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body, has immune and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aims to investigate whether BHB ameliorates the harmful effects induced by high glucose in ARPE-19 cells, a model of retinal pigment epithelium. We investigated the effects induced by high glucose and/or BHB on viability, migration, colony-forming ability, cell cycle progression and cytokine production. Our data indicate that high glucose significantly reduces the viability of ARPE-19 cells with no significant changes in apoptosis or autophagy, while inducing cell cytostasis. On the other hand, BHB exerts a protective effect on ARPE-19 cells under hyperglycemic conditions improving cell viability and alleviating glucose-induced cell cycle arrest. Additionally, BHB treatment affects the expression of IL-8 and IL-17alpha, as well as of MCP-1, modulating the inflammatory response, cell migration and wound healing. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential protective role of BHB against the detrimental effects induced by high glucose on ARPE-19 cells. These findings support the use of ketone bodies in mitigating high glucose-induced cellular damage.

The purpose was to assess the relationships of ketone bodies with biomarkers of metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative stress in MS. Methods: Blood samples and neurological assessments were obtained from 153 healthy controls (HC), 187 relapsing-remitting (RRMS), and 91 progressive MS (PMS) patients. AcAc, BHB, and acetone were measured using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Indices of inflammatory vulnerability (IVX), metabolic malnutrition (MMX), and metabolic vulnerability (MVX) were computed from the NMR profiles. Cholesterol, apolipoprotein, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant profiles were obtained. Regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and HC, RRMS, or PMS disease status. Results: AcAc and BHB levels were greater in MS compared to HC. BHB and ketone bodies were positively associated with disability on the MS Severity Scale and ambulation time. BHB was positively associated with IVX, MMX, and MVX. AcAc was positively associated with MMX and negatively associated with IVX and MVX. Total ketone body concentration was positively associated with MMX and MVX. BHB and AcAc levels were negatively associated with the amino acids alanine, valine, and leucine.

40048912,Beta-Hydroxybutyrate Attenuates Bronchial Smooth Muscle Pro-Inflammatory Cytokine Production.,"Asthma is a common airway condition causing breathing difficulties due to reversible airflow obstruction. It often affects obese individuals, with symptoms triggered by environmental factors that induce immune responses, leading to inflammation and bronchoconstriction. Bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) plays a central role in airway narrowing, driven by type 2 immune responses involving cytokines like IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, along with leukocytes including eosinophils and type 2 T-helper cells. These responses cause structural changes such as fibrosis and airway thickening, while BSM cells worsen asthma by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to allergens, microbial signals, or inflammatory cytokines from other cells. While current treatments manage asthma in most patients, alternative therapies are needed for difficult-to-treat cases, particularly prevalent in obese, allergic individuals. Emerging research suggests that therapeutic ketosis, induced by dietary changes or ketone supplementation, may reduce airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. The primary ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), produced during carbohydrate scarcity, acts via cell-surface receptors and transporters, potentially mitigating asthma symptoms. Weight loss and caloric restriction increase ketone levels, correlating with reduced inflammation and improved asthma outcomes. We hypothesized that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) reduces bronchoconstriction and inflammation in asthma by targeting bronchial smooth muscle. Using human bronchial smooth muscle cells (HBSMC) in vitro, we demonstrate herein that BHB suppresses IL-1beta-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production through Free Fatty Acid Receptor 3 (FFAR3) activation. These findings suggest that bronchial smooth muscle is a key target of therapeutic ketosis, supporting BHB's potential benefits in preclinical asthma models.",0,Adults with LC-FAOD; VLCADD; CPT2D; LCHADD,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples; NS,"lipolysis, down",Metabolic Regulation,NS,NS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders,Metabolic & Endocrine,"exercise parameters, no-change","Exercise capacity, no-change",D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB) salts,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),D-BHB

We explored supplementation of exogenous D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB) as an alternative source of energy in a randomized, double-blinded crossover pilot study. Participants >/=18 years of age with a diagnosis of LC-FAOD completed two moderate-intensity treadmill exercises following an oral supplementation of D-BHB salts or an isocaloric maltodextrin beverage. Five subjects (1 VLCADD, 2 CPT2D, 2 LCHADD), 60 % male, mean age = 33 years were enrolled. Mild to moderate GI symptoms were related to ingestion of D-BHB. Plasma D-BHB was increased after oral D-BHB compared to maltodextrin (p < .001) with an average concentration of 0.43 mM in the post-exercise period. During exercise, free fatty acids (p = .01), fold change in long-chain acylcarnitine species (LC-AC) (p </= .03) and systolic BP (p = .02) were lower after D-BHB compared to the maltodextrin beverage. D-BHB suppresses lipolysis and selectively blunts exercise-induced long-chain acylcarnitines. There were no differences between beverages in acetylcarnitine, blood glucose, creatine kinase, VO2, HR, RPE or respiratory exchange ratio. Consumption of the D-BHB beverage was safe and well-tolerated. Plasma D-BHB levels achieved mild ketosis and suppressed lipolysis and the associated rise in LC-AC, but fell short of stimulating the energetic effects that might have resulted in altered exercise parameters such as RER, or HR. In conclusion, our results provide a strong rationale for future studies aimed toward defining the optimal multiple-dose regimen of D-BHB per day that might improve exercise tolerance and understanding the long-term impact of treatment in LC-FAOD subjects.",0,mice; ex vivo live brain punches; in vivo photothrombotic stroke model,animal,Animal – Mouse; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice; Animal – Other Mammal,"brain metabolic effect, down",Metabolic Regulation,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Stroke,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"infarct size, down","Infarct size, down",NS,NS,NS

However, the acute effects of hyperglycemia on brain metabolism and function are not fully understood. The potential protective benefit of ketone bodies on mitochondrial function in the brain has also not been well characterized. Here, we evaluated the acute effects of hyperglycemia and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on brain metabolism by employing a novel approach leveraging adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependence of bioluminescence originating from luciferin-luciferase activity. Oxygen consumption rate was measured in ex vivo live brain punches to further evaluate mitochondrial function. Additionally, we investigated the functional relevance of BHB using an in vivo photothrombotic stroke model to assess its cerebroprotective effects. Our data demonstrate that brain metabolism in mice is affected by acute exposure to high glucose, at a level similar to consuming food or a beverage with high sucrose. This short-term effect of glucose exposure was reduced by co-administration with the ketone body BHB. Moreover, BHB significantly reduced infarct size in the brain stroke model, providing evidence for its functional protective role in the brain. These findings suggest that BHB may effectively mitigate the adverse effects of metabolic stress and ischemic events on brain metabolism and function.",FFAR3,human bronchial smooth muscle cells; mouse precision-cut lung slices (PCLS),human; animal; in vitro,In vitro – Primary cells; Multi-model,"FFAR3 activation, up",Metabolic Regulation,airway,Upper airway,human bronchial smooth muscle cells,Muscle – Smooth / Perivascular,Visceral smooth muscle,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Asthma,Respiratory,"bronchoconstriction, down","Pulmonary function, down",NS,NS,NS
40067386,Beta-Hydroxybutyrate Inhibits Bronchial Smooth Muscle Contraction.,"Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by airway inflammation, remodeling, and hyperresponsiveness to triggers causing airway constriction. Bronchial smooth muscle plays a critical role by narrowing airways, leading to obstruction and breathing difficulties, often exacerbated by mast cell infiltration and histamine release. Whereas current treatments, including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and biologics provide effective management for most patients, alternative therapies are needed for difficult-to-treat asthma. Recent research highlights the potential of therapeutic ketosis, achieved through dietary interventions or supplementation with exogenous ketones, to reduce airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. Ketone bodies, known for providing energy during carbohydrate scarcity, also influence asthma by activating cell-surface receptors and transporters. In vivo, interventions like weight loss and caloric restriction increase ketone body levels, correlating with improved asthma symptoms, reduced oxidative stress, and inflammation. These effects suggest ketone bodies, particularly beta-hydroxybutyrate, may play a therapeutic role in mitigating bronchoconstriction and smooth muscle contraction in asthma. We utilize human bronchial smooth muscle cells (in vitro) and mouse precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) (ex vivo) to assess the effects of BHB on histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. Brightfield microscopy showed that BHB reduces contraction in human bronchial smooth muscle cells, an effect involving free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3) activation. Light microscopy of PCLS revealed that BHB inhibits airway narrowing and cellular extrusion, demonstrating its ability to mitigate bronchoconstriction by suppressing smooth muscle contraction. These results implicate bronchial smooth muscle as a cellular target of therapeutic ketosis, an important contributor to the beneficial effects of BHB in preclinical models of asthma.",0,Col4a3-deficient mice with Alport nephropathy,animal,Animal – Mouse,"inflammation suppression, down; fibrosis suppression, down",Inflammation & Immune Response; Extracellular Matrix & Structural Remodeling,kidney,Kidney,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Alport syndrome,Genetic / Congenital,"glomerular filtration rate, up; lifespan, no-change","GFR, up; Lifespan, no-change","1,3-butanediol","1,3-Butanediol (BD)",NS
40069113,Oral Ketone Beta-Hydroxybutyrate Supplement Retards the Loss of Glomerular Filtration Rate in Alport Mice on Dual RAS/SGLT2 Blockade.,"BACKGROUND: Several studies suggest that dietary beta hydroxybutyrate supplementation delays the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by suppressing inflammation and fibrosis. We hypothesized that the oral supplementation with the beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) precursor 1,3-butanediol in addition to inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT)2 would be superior to dual RAS/SGLT2 blockade alone in attenuating the loss of glomerular filtration rate in Col4a3-deficient mice with Alport nephropathy, a spontaneous model of progressive CKD. METHODS: We performed a placebo-controlled study in Col4a3-deficient mice with Alport nephropathy. Treatment was initiated at a late stage of the disease at the age of six weeks. Mice were fed food admixes of 10 mug/g ramipril plus 30 mug/g empagliflozin with or without addition of 0,04g/g 1,3-butanediol (concentration per gram of bodyweight). The mice were monitored daily and sacrificed upon reaching renal failure. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured at the start of the treatment and after one and four weeks. RESULTS: The addition of beta hydroxybutyrate significantly attenuated the loss of glomerular filtration rate beyond the effect of dual RAS/SGLT2 blockade. The mean glomerular filtration rate after four weeks of treatment was 1.4+/-5.0 mul/min (vehicle), 61.3+/-51.1 mul/min (RASi + SGLT2i), and 138.9+/-68.5 mul/min (RASi + SGLT2i + 1,3-butanediol). No additional effects on lifespan could be observed. Kidney RNA sequencing revealed significant protective effects on inflammation when adding the beta hydroxybutyrate precursor 1,3-butanediol to RAS/SGLT2 inhibition. In histopathology, antifibrotic effects were seen upon beta hydroxybutyrate addition. CONCLUSIONS: The results in mice suggest that beta hydroxybutyrate supplementation improves the GFR in Alport syndrome by suppressing inflammation and fibrosis. However, the effects did not lead to a significant increase in lifespan. Furthermore, the observed effects stay behind the effects of finerenone as a combination partner, which was tested earlier in the same mouse model.",0,BDH1(cko) mice; littermate controls; permanent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation (MI); sham surgery,animal,Animal – Mouse; NS; Animal – Other Mammal,"cardiac ketone body oxidation, up",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,cardiomyocytes,Muscle – Cardiac,Cardiomyocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Multi-disease,"left ventricular ejection fraction, up","Ejection fraction, up",NS,NS,NS

We sought to determine whether SGLT2i-induced improvements in cardiac function are dependent on increased cardiac oxidation of ketone bodies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We employed a mouse model with a cardiac-specific knock-out of the enzyme D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase-1 (BDH1(cko)), rendering mice incapable of oxidizing the principal ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate in cardiomyocytes. Male BDH1(cko) and littermate controls underwent either permanent coronary artery ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery to induce myocardial infarction (MI) or sham surgery. Two weeks after surgery, mice were randomized to 6 weeks of empagliflozin or vehicle treatment. Cardiac function was assessed using transthoracic echocardiography before and after treatment, and histological and molecular analyses were performed after sacrifice. Empagliflozin treatment resulted in a twofold increase in circulating ketone bodies. Mean infarct size (36 +/- 4% of the left ventricle) was comparable among MI groups. In control mice, empagliflozin treatment resulted in a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) whereas LVEF remained stable in the vehicle treated group (DeltaLVEF -1.1 +/- 2.2% vs. 5.2 +/- 1.5%, p < 0.05). Empagliflozin did not influence cardiac contractility in BDH1(cko) mice (DeltaLVEF -5.9 +/- 2.1% vs. -1.5 +/- 2.8%, p = 0.213). Other echocardiographic, histological and molecular signatures of adverse myocardial remodelling were not affected by empagliflozin treatment. CONCLUSION: The beneficial effects of empagliflozin on cardiac contractility in post-MI heart failure are attenuated in mice which are incapable of oxidizing the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate in their hearts. These findings suggest that enhanced cardiac ketone body oxidation contributes to the cardioprotective effects of SGLT2i.",0,Adults without cardiac abnormalities,human,Human – Observational/Patient samples,"exogenous ketosis, up",Metabolic Regulation,heart,Heart,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan,Other / Unspecified,"myocardial blood flow, up; cardiac output, up","Cardiac function, up; Cardiac output, up",bis-hexanoyl R-1-3-butanediol (BH-BD),"1,3-Butanediol (BD)",NS

This study characterized cardiac function and blood flow responses to a ketogenic beverage compared to a volume/calorie matched placebo with repeated imaging over 120 min. This was a two-group, placebo-controlled, acute cardiac imaging study. Adults without cardiac abnormalities underwent baseline cardiac MRI including quantitative myocardial perfusion to measure myocardial blood flow (MBF). Subjects consumed 50 g of a ketogenic-promoting beverage [bis-hexanoyl R-1-3-butanediol (BH-BD)] (BH-BD; n = 11) or a calorically/volume-matched lipid-based placebo (PL; n = 10) with cardiac MRI every 15-30 min. Following 120 min, subjects underwent a final scan including MBF measurement. R-BHB and glucose were measured at every timepoint. 120 min following BH-BD consumption, R-BHB reached 2.1 mM. Cardiac output (CO) was elevated compared to PL (p < 0.05) and increased +31% 120 min after BH-BD ingestion (p < 0.001). CO elevation was due to increased stroke volume (+11%; p = 0.02) and heart rate (+22%; p < 0.001). MBF increased 29% from baseline (p < 0.001).

Mechanistically, BHB drove specific lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) of sorting nexin-9 (SNX9), a key regulator of MDV biogenesis. Kbhb increased SNX9 interaction with inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM)/matrix proteins and promoted the formation of IMM/matrix MDVs. SNX9 Kbhb was not only critical for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in cells but also protected mice from alcohol-induced liver injury.

For instance, starvation and low-carbohydrate diets lead to the accumulation of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), whose blood concentrations can reach millimolar levels, concomitant with the accumulation of lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) of proteins. Here we report that class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) unexpectedly catalyze the formation of Kbhb. Through mutational analysis, we show a shared reliance on key active site amino acids for classical deacetylation and noncanonical HDAC-catalyzed beta-hydroxybutyrylation. On the basis of these data, we propose that HDACs catalyze a condensation reaction between the free amine group on lysine and the BHB carboxylic acid, thereby generating an amide bond.

However, whether and how it is involved in ketone body metabolism is still unknown. The present study aims to investigate the role of lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) modification mediated by beta-HB in regulating ketone body metabolic homeostasis both in vivo and in vitro. The starvation ketosis and type 1 diabetes mouse models were introduced to evaluate the influence of beta-HB on Kbhb modification in mice. The Kbhb modifications of 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1 (OXCT1) and HMG-CoA synthase 2, two rate-limiting enzymes involved in ketogenesis and utilization, showed a positive correlation with the level of beta-HB both in vitro and in vivo. The modification levels of the enzymes increased during fasting but decreased after refeeding. However, the Kbhb modification level in all detected tissues showed minor change since the blood ketone body increased nonsignificantly in the type 1 diabetes mouse model. The in vitro experiments further indicated that mutation at the Kbhb modification site significantly inhibited the enzymatic activity of OXCT1 but not HMG-CoA synthase 2. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and CREB-binding protein (CBP) were identified both in vitro and in vivo as potential Kbhb dehydrogenase and transferase for OXCT1, respectively. Kbhb modification at lysine 421 of OXCT1 increases its enzyme activity during beta-HB accumulation, accelerating the utilization of the ketone body and finally maintaining metabolism homeostasis. Our present study proposes a new ketone body metabolic regulatory mode primarily mediated by Kbhb modifications of OXCT1 during beta-HB accumulation.",0,mice; in vivo photothrombotic stroke model; ex vivo live brain punches,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Other Mammal; Ex vivo – Tissue/Organ explant or slice,"mitochondrial function, up",Mitochondrial Function & Bioenergetics,brain,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Stroke,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"infarct size, down","Infarct size, down",NS,NS,NS
40319428,"beta-hydroxybutyrate enhances brain metabolism in normoglycemia and hyperglycemia, providing cerebroprotection in a mouse stroke model.","Hyperglycemia in poorly controlled diabetes is widely recognized as detrimental to organ dysfunction. However, the acute effects of hyperglycemia on brain metabolism and function are not fully understood. The potential protective benefit of ketone bodies on mitochondrial function in the brain has also not been well characterized. Here, we evaluated the acute effects of hyperglycemia and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on brain metabolism by employing a novel approach leveraging adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependence of bioluminescence originating from luciferin-luciferase activity. Oxygen consumption rate was measured in ex vivo live brain punches to further evaluate mitochondrial function. Our data demonstrate that brain metabolism in mice is affected by acute exposure to high glucose. This short-term effect of glucose exposure was reduced by co-administration with the ketone body BHB. Additionally, we investigated the functional relevance of BHB using an in vivo photothrombotic stroke model to assess its cerebroprotective effects in presence or absence of acute hyperglycemia. BHB significantly reduced infarct size in the brain stroke model, providing functional evidence for its protective role in the brain. These findings suggest that BHB may effectively mitigate the adverse effects of metabolic stress and ischemic events on brain metabolism and function.",LAMP2; HSPA1A; NLRP3; CASP1; IL1B; IL18; 0; GSDMD; APP; MAPT,Wistar male rats (HFFD + LPS AD-like model),animal,Animal – Rat,"chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), up",Cell Death & Survival,hippocampus,Brain/CNS,microglia,Neural / Glial,Microglia,lysosome,Lysosome,Unspecified,Alzheimer's disease,Neurodegenerative,"cognition, up","Cognition, up","125 mg/kg, p.o.",NS,NS

To model this pathological link, our AD-like model was developed by feeding Wistar male rats a high-fat diet with fructose in drinking water (HFFD) for 8 weeks, followed by a single dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This group was compared with a normal control group fed a standard diet and a beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)-treated group (125 mg/kg, p.o.), administered starting 3 h after LPS and continuing for 1 week. The results demonstrate that BHB treatment illuminated cognitive gains, as indicated by the Y-maze, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition tests. In addition, it preserved hippocampal cytoarchitecture, reduced neurodegeneration, and attenuated amyloid plaques and phosphorylated Tau deposition. Cellularly, BHB restored critical molecular mechanisms, including increased lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A) hippocampal content as the main marker of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), along with the chaperon protein Hsp70. Moreover, BHB alleviated neuroinflammation by inhibiting the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, and pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation alongside the downstream targets cleaved caspase-1 and IL-1beta/IL-18 cytokines. BHB also reduced pyroptotic markers, caspase-11 and gasdermin-N, and microglia-induced inflammation as it shifted microglial polarization toward the neuroprotective M2 phenotype. Finally, BHB normalized hippocampal neurotransmitter levels of the inhibited acetylcholine and serotonin. These findings support BHB as a promising, multifaceted treatment for AD, highlighting the roles of CMA, Hsp70, and 5-HT in slowing disease progression and improving cognitive function.",0,patients with IBD; DSS-induced colitis in wild-type and perforin-deficient (Prf1-/-) mice; CD8(+) T cell adoptive transfer model,human; animal,Human – Observational/Patient samples; Animal – Mouse; Multi-model,"beta-hydroxybutyrate production, down",Metabolic Regulation,colon,Large intestine/Colon,CD8(+) T cell,Unspecified / Mixed,Mixed cell population,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Colitis,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"intestinal inflammation, down; gut microbiota dysbiosis, down","Inflammation, down",NS,NS,NS
40331922,CD8(+) T Cell-Derived Perforin Exacerbates Dysbiosis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease via beta-Hydroxybutyrate Suppression in Mouse Colonic Epithelium.,"BACKGROUND: The etiology and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are generally thought to be related to immune dysfunction and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: We applied a DSS-induced colitis model in wild-type and perforin-deficient (Prf1(-/-) ) mice. Adoptive transfer experiments and metabolic profiling were conducted, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyzed gut microbiota. The impact of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) inhibitor on inflammation and dysbiosis was also assessed. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that perforin production in CD8(+) T cells was significantly increased in both patients with IBD and mice with colitis. Moreover, compared with wild-type mice, perforin deficiency (Prf1(-/-) ) mice exhibited mitigated inflammation in a DSS-induced colitis model. The CD8(+) T cell adoptive transfer model indicated that perforin produced by CD8(+) T cells directly induced colitis. Prf1(-/-) mice with colitis exhibited activation of the fatty acid metabolic process, highlighted by increased expression of Hmgcs2 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (Pdk4) in the colon and accumulation of the related metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate. The absence of perforin partly reversed the imbalance in the gut microbiota composition caused by DSS, including increases in Alloprevotella and Parabacteroides. However, the HMGCS2 inhibitor exacerbated intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis in Prf1(-/-) mice. CONCLUSION: CD8(+) T cell-derived perforin promoted colitis by disrupting gut microbiota composition through the suppression of beta-hydroxybutyrate production.

The ""thrifty substrate hypothesis"" suggests beta-OH-B provides more ATP per oxygen consumed than glucose or fatty acids.

However, it is currently unknown how acute KME ingestion impacts resting CBF and whether differences in KME dose have differential effects on CBF regulation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of two separate KME doses on resting CBF in young adults. On separate days and in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, 20 participants (10 females; aged 23 +/- 3 years) ingested either: (1) High-KME (0.6 g kg(-1) beta-OHB); (2) Low-KME (0.3 g kg(-1) beta-OHB); or (3) placebo drink, and quietly rested for 120 min. Global CBF (gCBF) was assessed using duplex ultrasound of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries, and transcranial Doppler ultrasound was used to assess middle cerebral artery blood velocity at baseline, 45 min and 120 min post-ingestion. End-tidal CO(2) ( PETCO2 ) was measured using a gas analyser. beta-OHB was measured in venous blood. At 45 min post-ingestion, gCBF was significantly reduced by 10.6% in Low-KME and by 14.6% in High-KME compared to baseline. At 120 min, gCBF returned towards baseline in Low-KME, whereas gCBF was further reduced by 19.1% in High-KME compared to baseline. KME dose-dependent reductions in PETCO2 may have contributed to these reductions in gCBF following KME ingestion. These novel findings provide a foundational characterization of the impact of KME on resting CBF, which prompts further investigation building on these results to isolate underlying mechanisms and develop dosing protocols to mitigate potential CO(2) disruptions. KEY POINTS: Beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) is a signalling molecule and beta-OHB infusion increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) in humans. Ingestion of higher doses of a ketone monoester (KME) supplement have been shown to lower blood pH and arterial CO(2), which are important regulators of CBF. This double-blind and placebo-controlled cross-over study tested the effects of two separate KME doses (Low-KME and High-KME) on resting CBF, end-tidal CO(2) and systemic haemodynamics over a 2 h period post-ingestion in young adults. Low-KME reduced CBF 45 min post-ingestion and High-KME reduced CBF at both 45 and 120 min post-ingestion, which corresponded with dose-dependent reductions in end-tidal CO(2). The findings from this trial represent a foundational characterization of the effects of KME dose on resting CBF.",0,NS,animal,NS,"neuroplasticity, up",Neurotransmission & Neuronal Plasticity,peri-infarct cortex,Brain/CNS,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Stroke,Cerebrovascular / Stroke,"functional recovery, up","Neurological deficit score, up","exogenous supplementation; (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-beta-HB, a ketone ester (KE); beta-HB monoester drinks",Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid); Ketone ester (KE),NS
40370533,Environmental enrichment promotes functional recovery from stroke via enhancing neuroplasticity through the action of beta-HB.,"Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability worldwide, unfortunately, no drugs are clinically available to promote functional recovery after stroke. Although animal environmental enrichment is a recognized paradigm for promoting stroke repair, elusive mechanisms hinder its clinical translation. Here, we show that beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) level in the peri-infarct cortex is upregulated after environmental enrichment (EE) exposure. Importantly, exogenous supplementation of beta-HB promotes functional recovery to a similar extent as EE exposure. Moreover, the beneficial effects of EE on stroke recovery, including functional recovery, neuroplasticity-related proteins upregulation, and structural and functional plasticity enhancement, are abolished by beta-HB transporter inhibitor, AR-C155858. Intriguingly, supplementation with (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-beta-HB, a ketone ester (KE), substantially increases beta-HB level and lessens motor functional impairments. Together, our findings indicate that beta-HB is a critical substrate for EE-mediated stroke recovery and supplementation with beta-HB monoester drinks may serve as a novel strategy to translate EE from bench to bedside.",STAT3,mice,animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse,"STAT3 signaling activation, up","Cell Proliferation, Growth & Differentiation",liver,Liver,hepatocyte,Epithelial – Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Ductal,Hepatocytes,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,Liver regeneration,Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary,"hepatocyte proliferation, up; liver regeneration, up","Cell survival, up; Liver regeneration, up",beta-hydroxybutyric acid,Exogenous BHB (unspecified/free acid),NS

The specific bacteria and mechanisms regulating liver regeneration post-PHx remain unclear. This study demonstrated dynamic changes in the abundance of Parabacteroides distasonis (P. distasonis) post-PHx, correlating with hepatocyte proliferation. Treatment with live P. distasonis significantly promoted hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration after PHx. Targeted metabolomics revealed a significant positive correlation between P. distasonis and beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB), as well as hyodeoxycholic acid and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid in the gut after PHx. Notably, treatment with BHB, but not hyodeoxycholic acid or 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, significantly promoted hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration in mice after PHx. Moreover, STAT3 inhibitor Stattic attenuated the promotive effects of BHB on cell proliferation and liver regeneration both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, P. distasonis upregulated the expression of fatty acid oxidation-related proteins, and increased BHB levels in the liver, and then BHB activated the STAT3 signaling pathway to promote liver regeneration. This study, for the first time, identifies the involvement of P. distasonis and its associated metabolite BHB in promoting liver regeneration after PHx, providing new insights for considering P. distasonis and BHB as potential strategies for promoting hepatic regeneration.",0,streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice,animal,Animal – Mouse,"anti-inflammatory effects, down",Inflammation & Immune Response,kidney,Kidney,NS,Unspecified / Mixed,NS,NS,Unspecified / Generic,NS,nan; Myopathy,Multi-disease; Musculoskeletal & Connective Tissue,"renal tubule injury and fibrosis, down; muscle atrophy, down","Fibrosis, down; Muscle atrophy, down",BHB supplementation,NS,NS

Strategies have been rapidly developed to reduce diabetic complications and the overall quality of life of patients with diabetes. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the most abundant ketone body generated from fatty acids in the liver, provides energy sources under nutrient deprivation and has various potential health benefits as a functional food. However, its role in diabetic pathologies is unclear. In this study, we examined the effect of BHB on the kidney and muscle functions in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. BHB supplementation exerted anti-inflammatory effects on the kidneys and improved renal tubule injury and fibrosis in STZ-induced mice. Furthermore, BHB alleviated diabetes-induced muscle atrophy, indicated by the increased fiber area and normalized fiber area distribution in BHB-supplemented STZ-treated mice. Our study demonstrates the beneficial effects of BHB in improving diabetic complications, particularly diabetic nephropathy and myopathy, and highlights the potential of BHB as a functional food for the treatment of diabetes.",UCP2; SIRT3; PPARGC1A; 0; HMGCS2,mice; chronic constriction injury (CCI),animal; in vitro,Animal – Mouse; Animal – Rat,"ROS production, down",Oxidative Stress & Antioxidant Defense,spinal dorsal horn,Spinal cord,microglia,Neural / Glial,Microglia,mitochondria,Mitochondria,Unspecified,Neuropathic pain,Neurodevelopmental & Neuropsychiatric,"thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, down","Mechanical allodynia, down",ketogenic diet (KD),Ketogenic diet (endogenous),NS
PMID,SIRT3 is required for the protective function of ketogenic diet on neural inflammation and neuropathic pain.,"Chronic neuroinflammation is a key pathological feature of neuropathic pain. The ketogenic diet (KD) has demonstrated potential to reduce neuronal excitability and alleviate inflammation in epilepsy, yet its effects and precise mechanisms in neuropathic pain remain elusive. We first observed that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a key metabolite induced by KD, was reduced in mice following neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI). Subsequently, we demonstrated that KD effectively alleviated CCI-induced thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, while mitigating neuroinflammation through reduced microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. BHB reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which coincided with enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential in microglia, thereby attenuating microglia-mediated inflammatory responses. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed KD-induced upregulation of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1alpha) in the spinal dorsal horn. Importantly, SIRT3 deficiency abolished KD's protective effects against neuropathic pain and reduced BHB levels, potentially attributable to diminished expression of hepatic ketone body synthases and spinal ketone body-utilizing enzymes. These findings highlight SIRT3 as a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain within the ketogenic diet paradigm, providing a foundation for novel therapeutic strategies.",BHB Target,Model Raw,Model Global,Model Cannonical,Mechanism Raw,Mechanism Cannonical,Organ/tissue Raw,Organ/tissue Cannonical,Cell Type Raw,Cell Type Global,Celly Type Cannonical,Organelle Raw,Organelle Global,Organelle Cannonical,Disease,Disease Category,Disease Outcome Nonstandardized,Disease Outcome Standardized,BHB Source Raw,BHB Source Cannonical,Isomer
